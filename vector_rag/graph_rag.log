Surrounded by the aforementioned mountain ranges is a region of moderate relief known as the central Iranian microcontinent containing, from east to west, the Lut, Tabas, and Yazd blocks(Figure 1a, inset). In southeastern Iran, the east-west-trending Makran ranges extend to southwestern Pakistan McCall, 1997. The oldest magmatic rocks in Iran have Late Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian ages(590-500 Ma) and have been related to an orogenic event along the Proto-Tethyan margin of the Gondwanaland Ramezani and Tucker, 2003; Hassanzadeh et al., 2008; Azizi et al., 2011; Chiu et al., 2013. During the Paleozoic, magmatism appeared to be largely inactive or of very limited extent throughout the country. From the Early Mezosoic to Late Cenozoic, extensive magmatism related to Neotethyan subduction was preserved in two magmatic belts subparallel to the Bitlis-Zagros suture one dominated by Jurassic-Cretaceous granitic plutons and volcanic rocks in the Sanandaj-Sirjan zone St ocklin, 1968 and another dominated by Paleogene volcanic rocks, i.e., the Urumieh-Dohktar magmatic arc(UDMA) Schroder, 1944; Alavi, 1994. The Paleogene magmatic activity was confined not only to the UDMA but also along the Alborz ranges and in the Lut-Sistan region, together representing a period of magmatic flare-up Berberian and King, 1981; Camp and Griffis 1982; Jung et al., 1983; Verdel et al., 2011; Pang et al., 2013a. Magmatic activity from the Miocene to Quaternary appeared to be less extensive compared to the Paleogene pulse and was confined to isolated volcanic centers in northwestern Iran e.g., Kheirkh', 'Concluding Remarks The important results of this study are summarized below 1. Magmatic activity of the Makran arc, previously considered to be active from the Late Miocene to Quaternary, might have actually commenced by the Early Miocene. The argument is based on the 19 Ma Mirabad pluton that is geochemically similar to the Taftan volcano. 4. The subduction zone generating the Makran arc might have been propagated from the one resulted in the UDMA to the northwest. The Makran represents a window of continental collision between the India-Eurasia collision zone to the east and the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone to the west.', 'Tectonic Implications Our results shed new lights on the geodynamic evolution of the Makran presented by McCall 1997 McCall, 2002. He noted that there were probably two coexisting subduction zones in the Makran during the Paleogene, one at which is now the southeastern UDMA and another resulted in a plutonic belt from Zahedan to Shah-Kuh running subparallel to it(Figure 1a). It was proposed that magmatic activity of the latter ceased toward the end of the Oligocene whereas the former shifted out in the Gulf of Oman at the Early Pliocene, a change accompanied by uplift and subsequent formation of the Makran arc. However, the initiation of the Makran arc magmatism at the Early Miocene, as discussed earlier based on our new data, implies that the Makran subduction likely began at pre-Miocene times. Recent zircon U-Pb dating results by Chiu et al. confirm that magmatic activity of the southeastern UDMA continued to the latest Pliocene. In view of the above, a likely scenario is that the Neotethyan subduction zone that generated the UDMA propagated from the northwest to southeast in the Gulf of Oman at pre-Miocene times and northward subduction since then produced the Makran arc(Figures 14a and 14b). A sudden jump of the subduction front at the Early Pliocene, as argued by McCall 1997 McCall, 2002, probably did not happen. Based on available data and observations, we propose that the Makran represents a window of continental collision between the India-Eurasia collision zone to the east and the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone to the west(see Figure 14 for details). It is part of the southern margin of Eurasia where remnant oceanic lithosphere of the Neotethys, as shown by heat flow data by Hutchison et al., has been destroyed in a subduction zone since the Early Miocene. At that time, a large part of Neotethys had been consumed in subduction zones along what are now the Indus-Yarlung suture to the east and the Bitlis-Zagros suture to the west. Prior to Miocene, it is either that subduction was inactive along this segment of the continental margin or that it did happened but left no magmatic record for some unknown reasons. An analogy can be drawn with the eastern Mediterranean that is also underlain by remnant Neot', ', a large part of Neotethys had been consumed in subduction zones along what are now the Indus-Yarlung suture to the east and the Bitlis-Zagros suture to the west. Prior to Miocene, it is either that subduction was inactive along this segment of the continental margin or that it did happened but left no magmatic record for some unknown reasons. An analogy can be drawn with the eastern Mediterranean that is also underlain by remnant Neotethyan oceanic lithosphere Garfunkel, and references therein; M uller et al., 2008. A major difference is that the Mediterranean Sea will be closed in the future when Africa and Eurasia finally converge, whereas oceanic lithosphere of the Indian Ocean will continue to subduct beneath the Makran arc until the arrival of a continental block at the subduction zone.']

Magmatic activity from the Miocene to Quaternary appeared to be less extensive compared to the Paleogene pulse and was confined to isolated volcanic centers in northwestern Iran e.g., Kheirkhah et al., 2009; Aghazadeh et al., 2010; Allen et al., 2013; Pang et al., 2013b, northern Iran Davidson et al., 2004, northeastern Iran(Quchan), eastern Iran Walker et al., 2009; Pang et al., 2012, and southeastern Iran Saadat and Stern, this study, and some volcanic centers and small plutons along the UDMA Jahangiri, 2007; Omrani et al., 2008; Chiu et al., 2013. A wide range of magma types with ultrapotassic, adakitic, alkali basaltic, calc-alkaline, and shoshonitic compositions has been identified for the Miocene-Quaternary magmatism.', 'aceous Zarrinkoub et al., 2012; Angiboust et al., 2013 whereas the Bitlis-Zagros suture records the collision of Arabia to Eurasia, or any terranes accreted to its southern margin, since the Late Eocene-Early Oligocene Allen and Armstrong, 2008; Agard et al., 2011; Ballato et al., 2011; McQuarrie and van Hinsbergen, 2013; McQuarrie et al., 2003. Surrounded by the aforementioned mountain ranges is a region of moderate relief known as the central Iranian microcontinent containing, from east to west, the Lut, Tabas, and Yazd blocks(Figure 1a, inset). In southeastern Iran, the east-west-trending Makran ranges extend to southwestern Pakistan McCall, 1997. The oldest magmatic rocks in Iran have Late Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian ages(590-500 Ma) and have been related to an orogenic event along the Proto-Tethyan margin of the Gondwanaland Ramezani and Tucker, 2003; Hassanzadeh et al., 2008; Azizi et al., 2011; Chiu et al., 2013. During the Paleozoic, magmatism appeared to be largely inactive or of very limited extent throughout the country. From the Early Mezosoic to Late Cenozoic, extensive magmatism related to Neotethyan subduction was preserved in two magmatic belts subparallel to the Bitlis-Zagros suture one dominated by Jurassic-Cretaceous granitic plutons and volcanic rocks in the Sanandaj-Sirjan zone St ocklin, 1968 and another dominated by Paleogene volcanic rocks, i.e., the Urumieh-Dohktar magmatic arc(UDMA) Schroder, 1944; Alavi, 1994. The Paleogene magmatic activity was confined not only to the UDMA but also along the Alborz ranges and in the Lut-Sistan region, together representing a period of magmatic flare-up Berberian and King, 1981; Camp and Griffis 1982; Jung et al., 1983; Verdel et al., 2011; Pang et al., 2013a. Magmatic activity from the Miocene to Quaternary appeared to be less extensive compared to the Paleogene pulse and was confined to isolated volcanic centers in northwestern Iran e.g., Kheirkh', 'Concluding Remarks The important results of this study are summarized below 1. Magmatic activity of the Makran arc, previously considered to be active from the Late Miocene to Quaternary, might have actually commenced by the Early Miocene. The argument is based on the 19 Ma Mirabad pluton that is geochemically similar to the Taftan volcano. 4. The subduction zone generating the Makran arc might have been propagated from the one resulted in the UDMA to the northwest. The Makran represents a window of continental collision between the India-Eurasia collision zone to the east and the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone to the west.', 'Tectonic Implications Our results shed new lights on the geodynamic evolution of the Makran presented by McCall 1997 McCall, 2002. He noted that there were probably two coexisting subduction zones in the Makran during the Paleogene, one at which is now the southeastern UDMA and another resulted in a plutonic belt from Zahedan to Shah-Kuh running subparallel to it(Figure 1a). It was proposed that magmatic activity of the latter ceased toward the end of the Oligocene whereas the former shifted out in the Gulf of Oman at the Early Pliocene, a change accompanied by uplift and subsequent formation of the Makran arc. However, the initiation of the Makran arc magmatism at the Early Miocene, as discussed earlier based on our new data, implies that the Makran subduction likely began at pre-Miocene times. Recent zircon U-Pb dating results by Chiu et al. confirm that magmatic activity of the southeastern UDMA continued to the latest Pliocene. In view of the above, a likely scenario is that the Neotethyan subduction zone that generated the UDMA propagated from the northwest to southeast in the Gulf of Oman at pre-Miocene times and northward subduction since then produced the Makran arc(Figures 14a and 14b). A sudden jump of the subduction front at the Early Pliocene, as argued by McCall 1997 McCall, 2002, probably did not happen. Based on available data and observations, we propose that the Makran represents a window of continental collision between the India-Eurasia collision zone to the east and the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone to the west(see Figure 14 for details). It is part of the southern margin of Eurasia where remnant oceanic lithosphere of the Neotethys, as shown by heat flow data by Hutchison et al., has been destroyed in a subduction zone since the Early Miocene. At that time, a large part of Neotethys had been consumed in subduction zones along what are now the Indus-Yarlung suture to the east and the Bitlis-Zagros suture to the west. Prior to Miocene, it is either that subduction was inactive along this segment of the continental margin or that it did happened but left no magmatic record for some unknown reasons.

From the Early Mezosoic to Late Cenozoic, extensive magmatism related to Neotethyan subduction was preserved in two magmatic belts subparallel to the Bitlis-Zagros suture one dominated by Jurassic-Cretaceous granitic plutons and volcanic rocks in the Sanandaj-Sirjan zone St ocklin, 1968 and another dominated by Paleogene volcanic rocks, i.e., the Urumieh-Dohktar magmatic arc(UDMA) Schroder, 1944; Alavi, 1994. The Paleogene magmatic activity was confined not only to the UDMA but also along the Alborz ranges and in the Lut-Sistan region, together representing a period of magmatic flare-up Berberian and King, 1981; Camp and Griffis 1982; Jung et al., 1983; Verdel et al., 2011; Pang et al., 2013a.

The Makran represents a window of continental collision between the India-Eurasia collision zone to the east and the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone to the west.', 'Tectonic Implications Our results shed new lights on the geodynamic evolution of the Makran presented by McCall 1997 McCall, 2002. He noted that there were probably two coexisting subduction zones in the Makran during the Paleogene, one at which is now the southeastern UDMA and another resulted in a plutonic belt from Zahedan to Shah-Kuh running subparallel to it(Figure 1a). It was proposed that magmatic activity of the latter ceased toward the end of the Oligocene whereas the former shifted out in the Gulf of Oman at the Early Pliocene, a change accompanied by uplift and subsequent formation of the Makran arc. However, the initiation of the Makran arc magmatism at the Early Miocene, as discussed earlier based on our new data, implies that the Makran subduction likely began at pre-Miocene times. Recent zircon U-Pb dating results by Chiu et al. confirm that magmatic activity of the southeastern UDMA continued to the latest Pliocene. In view of the above, a likely scenario is that the Neotethyan subduction zone that generated the UDMA propagated from the northwest to southeast in the Gulf of Oman at pre-Miocene times and northward subduction since then produced the Makran arc(Figures 14a and 14b). A sudden jump of the subduction front at the Early Pliocene, as argued by McCall 1997 McCall, 2002, probably did not happen. Based on available data and observations, we propose that the Makran represents a window of continental collision between the India-Eurasia collision zone to the east and the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone to the west(see Figure 14 for details). It is part of the southern margin of Eurasia where remnant oceanic lithosphere of the Neotethys, as shown by heat flow data by Hutchison et al., has been destroyed in a subduction zone since the Early Miocene. At that time, a large part of Neotethys had been consumed in subduction zones along what are now the Indus-Yarlung suture to the east and the Bitlis-Zagros suture to the west. Prior to Miocene, it is either that subduction was inactive along this segment of the continental margin or that it did happened but left no magmatic record for some unknown reasons.

However, the following geochemical features point to contribution from the mantle in magma genesis(i) the basaltic and andesitic compositions(56 wt  SiO 2) of some Bazman and Taftan samples(Figure 5a Gill, 1981; Thorpe, 1982; Pearce and Peate, 1995. Lee et al. presented new thermobarometers based on Si and Mg contents of basaltic magmas to estimate the temperature and pressure(P-T) of magma generation. Using the Excel spreadsheet developed by these authors for fractionation correction and P-T estimation, we obtain 1400 C and 2.3 GPa for a basaltic sample in the vicinity of the Bazman volcano(Figure 10). It is the only available analysis in the Makran arc having MgO high enough(8.5 wt) for estimation on anhydrous basis. Because the qualitative effect of H 2 O addition is a shift to lower temperature and higher pressure see Lee et al., 2009, the estimated pressure of 2.3 GPa can be considered a minimum pressure of magma generation, corresponding to a depth of 76 km in the subarc upper mantle. Samples with 3 wt  MgO(on a volatile-free basis), a subset which should be less strongly affected by magma differentiation are screened to examine the features of the mantle source. Because of limited fluid mobility and different relative incompatibilities, the elements Nb and Yb are ideal to examine the degree of enrichment(or depletion) of the magma source. The NbYb of this subset of samples is from 3.6 to 9. a range lying between values of average enriched mid-ocean ridge basalt(E-MORB; 3.5) and oceanic island basalts(OIB; 22) see Sun and McDonough, 1989. This indicates that the mantle source is enriched in the more incompatible trace elements(e.g., Nb) or the degree of melting is low, or a combination of both. However, the calc-alkaline character of the studied rocks is consistent with normal degrees of mantle melting in arc settings(i.e., 5-15) and the alternative possibility of magma derivation', 'Introduction A fundamental step in unraveling the complex geodynamic history of orogenic belts is the establishment of magmatic records, which involve careful sampling, precise age determination, and geochemical characterization of magmatic products in a given region e.g., Lustrino et al., 2011; Seghedi and Downes, 2011; Prelevic nd Seghedi, 2013.

The terrane collision resulted in the obduction of ophiolitic rocks Ghazi et al., 2004 and the development of mountain ranges including the Alborz-Kopeh Dagh ranges in northern Iran, the Zagros ranges in southwestern Iran, and the east Iranian ranges. The mountain ranges are juxtaposed with major suture zones, for example, a Paleotethyan suture along the Alborz-Kopeh Dagh ranges Alavi et al., 1997, the Bitlis-Zagros suture along the Zagros ranges Agard et al., and references therein, and the Sistan suture along the east Iranian ranges Tirrul et al., 1983; McCall, 1997(Figure 1a, inset).

He noted that there were probably two coexisting subduction zones in the Makran during the Paleogene, one at which is now the southeastern UDMA and another resulted in a plutonic belt from Zahedan to Shah-Kuh running subparallel to it(Figure 1a). It was proposed that magmatic activity of the latter ceased toward the end of the Oligocene whereas the former shifted out in the Gulf of Oman at the Early Pliocene, a change accompanied by uplift and subsequent formation of the Makran arc. However, the initiation of the Makran arc magmatism at the Early Miocene, as discussed earlier based on our new data, implies that the Makran subduction likely began at pre-Miocene times. Recent zircon U-Pb dating results by Chiu et al. confirm that magmatic activity of the southeastern UDMA continued to the latest Pliocene. In view of the above, a likely scenario is that the Neotethyan subduction zone that generated the UDMA propagated from the northwest to southeast in the Gulf of Oman at pre-Miocene times and northward subduction since then produced the Makran arc(Figures 14a and 14b). A sudden jump of the subduction front at the Early Pliocene, as argued by McCall 1997 McCall, 2002, probably did not happen. Based on available data and observations, we propose that the Makran represents a window of continental collision between the India-Eurasia collision zone to the east and the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone to the west(see Figure 14 for details). It is part of the southern margin of Eurasia where remnant oceanic lithosphere of the Neotethys, as shown by heat flow data by Hutchison et al., has been destroyed in a subduction zone since the Early Miocene. At that time, a large part of Neotethys had been consumed in subduction zones along what are now the Indus-Yarlung suture to the east and the Bitlis-Zagros suture to the west. Prior to Miocene, it is either that subduction was inactive along this segment of the continental margin or that it did happened but left no magmatic record for some unknown reasons.

This paper investigates the petrogenesis and tectonic implications of a suite of magmatic rocks from the Makran arc, southeastern Iran, which is located in a poorly studied segment within the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt. The arc, which spans across southeastern Iran and southwestern Pakistan, is the surface expression of a 1000 km long subduction system situated between the India-Eurasia collision zone and the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone McCall, 1997 McCall,, 2002. Its volcanic activity is manifested by a linear belt of three large eruptive centers including the Taftan and Bazman volcanoes in southeastern Iran, and the Koh-i-Saltan volcano in southwestern Pakistan, and many small eruptive centers between them. Sparse KAr and 39 Ar 40 Ar age data for rocks from the above volcanoes indicate an age range from the Late Miocene to Quaternary, a period generally taken as indicative of active arc magmatism. However, most previous investigations of the Makran arc have focused on its structure and seismicity Byrne et al., 1992; Kopp et al., 2000; Grando and McClay, 2007; Regard et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2012 Smith et al.,, 2013, and geochemical characterization of its magmatic rocks has not been systematically performed. In this study, we attempt to develop, together with published data, a magmatic record for the Makran arc using zircon U-Pb geochronology, bulk-rock elemental, and Sr-Nd isotopic geochemistry for a suite of magmatic rocks collected in the vicinity of the Taftan and Bazman regions, southeastern Iran. Our objectives are to better understand(i) the timing and duration of arc magmatism,(ii) the petrogenetic processes responsible for any geochemical variations among the arc rocks, and(iii) the tectonic implications associated with the formation of the arc.

Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems PUBLICATIONS 2. Background 2.1. Regional Geology The paleogeographic and tectonic evolution of Iran was presented in detail by St ocklin, Berberian and King, and Ramezani and Tucker, and only a brief summary is given here. As part of the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic system, Iran consists of a tectonic collage of Gondwana-derived terranes that had been successively accreted to the southern margin of Eurasia Dewey et al., 1973; S eng or et al., 1988; Alavi, 1994; S eng or and Natalin, 1996. The terrane collision resulted in the obduction of ophiolitic rocks Ghazi et al., 2004 and the development of mountain ranges including the Alborz-Kopeh Dagh ranges in northern Iran, the Zagros ranges in southwestern Iran, and the east Iranian ranges. The mountain ranges are juxtaposed with major suture zones, for example, a Paleotethyan suture along the Alborz-Kopeh Dagh ranges Alavi et al., 1997, the Bitlis-Zagros suture along the Zagros ranges Agard et al., and references therein, and the Sistan suture along the east Iranian ranges Tirrul et al., 1983; McCall, 1997(Figure 1a, inset). The latter two sutures are Neotethyan in nature; the north-south-trending Sistan suture marks the collision between the Lut and Afghan(or Helmand) microcontinental blocks in the Late Cretaceous Zarrinkoub et al., 2012; Angiboust et al., 2013 whereas the Bitlis-Zagros suture records the collision of Arabia to Eurasia, or any terranes accreted to its southern margin, since the Late Eocene-Early Oligocene Allen and Armstrong, 2008; Agard et al., 2011; Ballato et al., 2011; McQuarrie and van Hinsbergen, 2013; McQuarrie et al., 2003', 'A Three-Component Model for Magma Genesis The petrogenetic constraints placed in the earlier section allow the establishment of a generalized model for magma genesis in the Makran arc. As described and explained below, the model consists of three components that are essential to explain the geochemical variations of the studied rocks. A depleted mantle component. The component is signified by the unradiogenic Sr and radiogenic Nd isotopic compositions, indicating time-integrated LILE and LREE depletion compared to the Bulk Silicate Earth. The component likely represents the subarc mantle wedge that underwent melt extraction long enough to impart a depleted signal with respect to Sr-Nd isotopes. At Makran, this component is the most obvious in the basaltic samples from the Bazman volcano. A trace element-rich component. The component is marked by enrichments in all incompatible trace elements and is responsible for imparting an orogenic geochemical signature to the mantle source. Although its RbSr is higher and SmNd lower than the Bulk Silicate Earth, the component does not reside in the lithosphere long enough to evolve to enriched Sr-Nd isotopic compositions. The component likely represents partial melts of subducted sediments andor slab-derived hydrous fluid. At Makran, this component is hidden in the relatively primitive samples showing orogenic signatures and depleted Sr-Nd isotopic compositions from the Bazman and Taftan volcanoes. An isotopically enriched component. The component is characterized by radiogenic Sr and unradiogenic Nd isotopic compositions, suggesting time-integrated LILE and LREE enrichment compared to the Bulk Silicate Earth.

However, the following geochemical features point to contribution from the mantle in magma genesis(i) the basaltic and andesitic compositions(56 wt  SiO 2) of some Bazman and Taftan samples(Figure 5a Gill, 1981; Thorpe, 1982; Pearce and Peate, 1995. Lee et al. presented new thermobarometers based on Si and Mg contents of basaltic magmas to estimate the temperature and pressure(P-T) of magma generation. Using the Excel spreadsheet developed by these authors for fractionation correction and P-T estimation, we obtain 1400 C and 2.3 GPa for a basaltic sample in the vicinity of the Bazman volcano(Figure 10). It is the only available analysis in the Makran arc having MgO high enough(8.5 wt) for estimation on anhydrous basis. Because the qualitative effect of H 2 O addition is a shift to lower temperature and higher pressure see Lee et al., 2009, the estimated pressure of 2.3 GPa can be considered a minimum pressure of magma generation, corresponding to a depth of 76 km in the subarc upper mantle. Samples with 3 wt  MgO(on a volatile-free basis), a subset which should be less strongly affected by magma differentiation are screened to examine the features of the mantle source. Because of limited fluid mobility and different relative incompatibilities, the elements Nb and Yb are ideal to examine the degree of enrichment(or depletion) of the magma source. The NbYb of this subset of samples is from 3.6 to 9. a range lying between values of average enriched mid-ocean ridge basalt(E-MORB; 3.5) and oceanic island basalts(OIB; 22) see Sun and McDonough, 1989. This indicates that the mantle source is enriched in the more incompatible trace elements(e.g., Nb) or the degree of melting is low, or a combination of both. However, the calc-alkaline character of the studied rocks is consistent with normal degrees of mantle melting in arc settings(i.e., 5-15) and the alternative possibility of magma derivation', 'Introduction A fundamental step in unraveling the complex geodynamic history of orogenic belts is the establishment of magmatic records, which involve careful sampling, precise age determination, and geochemical characterization of magmatic products in a given region e.g., Lustrino et al., 2011; Seghedi and Downes, 2011; Prelevic nd Seghedi, 2013. This paper investigates the petrogenesis and tectonic implications of a suite of magmatic rocks from the Makran arc, southeastern Iran, which is located in a poorly studied segment within the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt. The arc, which spans across southeastern Iran and southwestern Pakistan, is the surface expression of a 1000 km long subduction system situated between the India-Eurasia collision zone and the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone McCall, 1997 McCall,, 2002. Its volcanic activity is manifested by a linear belt of three large eruptive centers including the Taftan and Bazman volcanoes in southeastern Iran, and the Koh-i-Saltan volcano in southwestern Pakistan, and many small eruptive centers between them. Sparse KAr and 39 Ar 40 Ar age data for rocks from the above volcanoes indicate an age range from the Late Miocene to Quaternary, a period generally taken as indicative of active arc magmatism. However, most previous investigations of the Makran arc have focused on its structure and seismicity Byrne et al., 1992; Kopp et al., 2000; Grando and McClay, 2007; Regard et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2012 Smith et al.,, 2013, and geochemical characterization of its magmatic rocks has not been systematically performed. In this study, we attempt to develop, together with published data, a magmatic record for the Makran arc using zircon U-Pb geochronology, bulk-rock elemental, and Sr-Nd isotopic geochemistry for a suite of magmatic rocks collected in the vicinity of the Taftan and Bazman regions, southeastern Iran. Our objectives are to better understand(i) the timing and duration of arc magmatism,(ii) the petrogenetic processes responsible for any geochemical variations among the arc rocks, and(iii) the tectonic implications associated with the formation of the arc.

Regional Geology The paleogeographic and tectonic evolution of Iran', 'Concluding Remarks The important results of this study are summarized below 1. Magmatic activity of the Makran arc, previously considered to be active from the Late Miocene to Quaternary, might have actually commenced by the Early Miocene. The argument is based on the 19 Ma Mirabad pluton that is geochemically similar to the Taftan volcano. 4. The subduction zone generating the Makran arc might have been propagated from the one resulted in the UDMA to the northwest. The Makran represents a window of continental collision between the India-Eurasia collision zone to the east and the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone to the west.', ' along the Alborz ranges and in the Lut-Sistan region, together representing a period of magmatic flare-up Berberian and King, 1981; Camp and Griffis 1982; Jung et al., 1983; Verdel et al., 2011; Pang et al., 2013a. Magmatic activity from the Miocene to Quaternary appeared to be less extensive compared to the Paleogene pulse and was confined to isolated volcanic centers in northwestern Iran e.g., Kheirkhah et al., 2009; Aghazadeh et al., 2010; Allen et al., 2013; Pang et al., 2013b, northern Iran Davidson et al., 2004, northeastern Iran(Quchan), eastern Iran Walker et al., 2009; Pang et al., 2012, and southeastern Iran Saadat and Stern, this study, and some volcanic centers and small plutons along the UDMA Jahangiri, 2007; Omrani et al., 2008; Chiu et al., 2013. A wide range of magma types with ultrapotassic, adakitic, alkali basaltic, calc-alkaline, and shoshonitic compositions has been identified for the Miocene-Quaternary magmatism.', 'b, Ta, and Ti anomalies that are the hallmarks of high 3 He 4 He basalts and the FOZO mantle end-member Jackson et al., 2007a Jackson et al.,, 2008. Mantle source compositions are modeled in section 7 using the techniques of Minster and Allegre, and Tau and Ofol give surprisingly comparable sources. Consideration of possible long-term isotopic evolution of these sources in section 8 suggests that these mantle compositions have undergone young modification. Section 9 uses the petrologic model of Lee et al. to derive P-T estimates for the melting of Tau and Ofol mantle. Kinetic modeling is used in section 10 to assess possible effects of melt-wall rock re-equilibration on these P-T estimates.', 'ftan and Bazman regions, southeastern Iran.

Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems PUBLICATIONS 2. Background 2.1. Regional Geology The paleogeographic and tectonic evolution of Iran was presented in detail by St ocklin, Berberian and King, and Ramezani and Tucker, and only a brief summary is given here. As part of the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic system, Iran consists of a tectonic collage of Gondwana-derived terranes that had been successively accreted to the southern margin of Eurasia Dewey et al., 1973; S eng or et al., 1988; Alavi, 1994; S eng or and Natalin, 1996. The terrane collision resulted in the obduction of ophiolitic rocks Ghazi et al., 2004 and the development of mountain ranges including the Alborz-Kopeh Dagh ranges in northern Iran, the Zagros ranges in southwestern Iran, and the east Iranian ranges. The mountain ranges are juxtaposed with major suture zones, for example, a Paleotethyan suture along the Alborz-Kopeh Dagh ranges Alavi et al., 1997, the Bitlis-Zagros suture along the Zagros ranges Agard et al., and references therein, and the Sistan suture along the east Iranian ranges Tirrul et al., 1983; McCall, 1997(Figure 1a, inset). The latter two sutures are Neotethyan in nature; the north-south-trending Sistan suture marks the collision between the Lut and Afghan(or Helmand) microcontinental blocks in the Late Cretaceous Zarrinkoub et al., 2012; Angiboust et al., 2013 whereas the Bitlis-Zagros suture records the collision of Arabia to Eurasia, or any terranes accreted to its southern margin, since the Late Eocene-Early Oligocene Allen and Armstrong, 2008; Agard et al., 2011; Ballato et al., 2011; McQuarrie and van Hinsbergen, 2013; McQuarrie et al., 2003', 'A Three-Component Model for Magma Genesis The petrogenetic constraints placed in the earlier section allow the establishment of a generalized model for magma genesis in the Makran arc. As described and explained below, the model consists of three components that are essential to explain the geochemical variations of the studied rocks. A depleted mantle component. The component is signified by the unradiogenic Sr and radiogenic Nd isotopic compositions, indicating time-integrated LILE and LREE depletion compared to the Bulk Silicate Earth. The component likely represents the subarc mantle wedge that underwent melt extraction long enough to impart a depleted signal with respect to Sr-Nd isotopes. At Makran, this component is the most obvious in the basaltic samples from the Bazman volcano. A trace element-rich component. The component is marked by enrichments in all incompatible trace elements and is responsible for imparting an orogenic geochemical signature to the mantle source. Although its RbSr is higher and SmNd lower than the Bulk Silicate Earth, the component does not reside in the lithosphere long enough to evolve to enriched Sr-Nd isotopic compositions. The component likely represents partial melts of subducted sediments andor slab-derived hydrous fluid. At Makran, this component is hidden in the relatively primitive samples showing orogenic signatures and depleted Sr-Nd isotopic compositions from the Bazman and Taftan volcanoes. An isotopically enriched component. The component is characterized by radiogenic Sr and unradiogenic Nd isotopic compositions, suggesting time-integrated LILE and LREE enrichment compared to the Bulk Silicate Earth. The component likely represents the continental crust whose elements were extracted from the mantle long enough for the Sr-Nd isotopes to evolve to enriched compositions.
