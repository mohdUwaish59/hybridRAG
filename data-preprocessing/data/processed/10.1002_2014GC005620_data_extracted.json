        "title": "Source and magma mixing processes in continental subduction factory: Geochemical evidence from postcollisional mafic igneous rocks in the Dabie orogen",
        "abstract": "Postcollisional mafic igneous rocks commonly exhibit petrological and geochemical heterogeneities, but their origin still remains enigmatic. While source mixing is substantial due to the crustmantle interaction during continental collision, magma mixing is also significant during postcollisional magmatism. The two processes are illustrated by Early Cretaceous mafic igneous rocks in the Dabie orogen. These mafic rocks show arc-like trace element distribution patterns and enriched Sr-Nd-Pb isotope compositions, indicating their origination from enriched mantle sources. They have variable whole-rock e Nd (t) values of 217.6 to 25.2 and zircon e Hf (t) values of 229.0 to 27.7, pointing to source heterogeneities. Such whole-rock geochemical features are interpreted by the source mixing through melt-peridotite reaction in the continental subduction channel. Clinopyroxene and plagioclase megacrystals show complex textural and compositional variations, recording three stages of mineral crystallization during magma evolution. Cpx-1 core has low Cr and Ni but high Ba, Rb and K, indicating its crystallization from a mafic melt (Melt 1) derived from partial melting of hydrous peridotite rich in phlogopite. Cpx-1 mantle and Cpx-2 exhibit significantly high Cr, Ni and Al 2 O 3 but low Rb and Ba, suggesting their crystallization from pyroxenite-derived mafic melt (Melt 2). Whole-rock initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of gabbro lies between those of Pl-1core (crystallized from Melt 1) and Pl-1 mantle and Pl-2 core (crystallized from Melt 2), providing isotopic evidence for magma mixing between Melt 1 and Melt 2. Taken together, a heterogeneously enriched mantle source would be generated by the source mixing due to reaction of the overlying subcontinental lithospheric mantle wedge peridotite with felsic melts derived from partial melting of different rocks of the deeply subducted continental crust during the continental collision. The magma mixing would occur between mafic melts that were derived from partial melting of the heterogeneously metasomatic mantle domains in the postcollisional stage. As a consequence, the source and magma mixing processes in the continental subduction factory are responsible for the significant variations in the whole-rock and mineral geochemistries of postcollisional mafic igneous rocks.",

        "Introduction": "Introduction\nIt is known that interaction of the mantle wedge with fluids derived from dehydration of subducting oceanic crust is responsible for supra-subduction-zone (SSZ) arc volcanism [e.g.,\nHawkesworth et al., 1991;\nTatsumi and Eggins, 1995;\nSpandler and Pirard, 2013]\n. This interaction is a process of source mixing between slab-derived fluids and the mantle wedge peridotite, which is a key to recycling of crustal components at oceanic subductuion zones and thus usually referred to part of the subduction factory [e.g.,\nStern, 2002]\n. As such, the fluid-peridotite reaction at the slab-mantle interface in oceanic subduction channel is responsible for the generation of mantle sources for oceanic arc basalts\n[Bebout, 2007;\nZheng, 2012]\n. If felsic melts instead of aqueous fluids would be produced by partial melting of subducted crustal rocks, the meltperidotite reaction at the slab-mantle interface in subcontinental subduction channel is responsible for the generation of mantle sources for continental arc andesites\n[Chen et al., 2014]\n. Thus, slab-derived fluids/melts are a critical medium that transfer the crustal components to the mantle sources of oceanic and continental arc volcanics. It is possible that the melt-peridotite reaction would be also operated the slab-mantle Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems PUBLICATIONS interface during the subduction of continental crust to mantle depths\n[Zheng and Hermann, 2014]\n, generating olivine-poor ultramafic lithologies for mafic magmatism in the continental subduction factory\n[Zhao et al., 2013]\n. Therefore, the source mixing between the subducted crustal components and the mantle wedge peridotite is a key to the heterogeneity of mantle sources for mafic igneous rocks.\nThe source heterogeneity can be indicated not only by the geochemistry of mafic igneous rocks, but also by the lithology of their parental rocks. Studies of mantle-derived xenoliths and experimental petrology suggest that pyroxene, hornblende and phlogopite can form by reaction of the mantle wedge peridotite with hydrous felsic melts derived from dehydration melting of subducting crustal rocks\n[Yaxley and Green, 1998;\nRapp et al., 1999\nRapp et al., , 2010;;\nProuteau et al., 2001;\nColtorti et al., 2004;\nBerly et al., 2006]\n. As such, the meltperidotite reaction is a physicochemical mechanism for the source mixing of mafic igneous rocks. In addition, magma mixing between two or more melt batches can result in petrological and geochemical heterogeneities of igneous rocks. In order to decipher the petrogenesis of heterogeneous mafic igneous rocks in continental collision orogens, it is also necessary to take into account the magma mixing, which may have played an important role in modifying the composition of mafic melts with reference to that of their mantle sources. In this case, it is intriguing whether there are the both magma mixing and source mixing for the petrogenesis of heterogeneous postcollisional mafic magmatic rocks.\nPostcollisional mafic igneous rocks are widespread in the Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt\n[Zhao and Zheng, 2009]\n, providing us with an excellent opportunity to decipher the processes in the continental subduction factory\n[Zheng, 2012]\n. A number of whole-rock geochemical studies have revealed that these mafic rocks are characterized by arc-like trace element distribution patterns such as the enrichment of large ion lithophile elements (LILE) and light rare earth elements (LREE), but the depletion of high field strength elements (HFSE). They exhibit high initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios and negative e Nd (t) values, and different O isotope compositions compared to normal mantle values. In addition, their element and isotope compositions display high heterogeneities [e.g.,\nDai et al., 2011;\nZhang et al., 2013;\nZhao et al., 2013]\n. These features were interpreted to indicate incorporation of the deeply subducted continental crust into their mantle source [e.g.,\nJahn et al., 1999;\nFan et al., 2004;\nWang et al., 2005;\nZhao et al., 2005\nZhao et al., , 2011;;\nHuang et al., 2007;\nDai et al., 2011\nDai et al., , 2012\n]. However, these previous studies were mainly focused on whole-rock geochemistry [e.g.,\nJahn et al., 1999;\nZhao et al., 2005;\nHuang et al., 2007;\nXu et al., 2012]\n, which have limited potential to unravel various petrogenetic processes such as source mixing, partial melting, fractional crystallization, magma mixing, crustal contamination and magma degassing. While these six processes may have operated to variable extents in different stages of petrogenesis, one of these processes may be primarily recorded by a given type of geochemical data. In order to track the magma mixing in addition to the source mixing, for instance, it is necessary to acquire detailed mineralogical information such as mineral inclusions, element and isotope zonings.\nIn this paper, we present a combined study of mineral in situ element and isotope compositions, zircon U-Pb ages and Lu-Hf isotopes, and whole-rock major-trace elements and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes for postcollisional mafic igneous rocks from the Dabie orogen. The results are interpreted in an integrated way in order to distinguish the magma mixing from the source mixing during mafic magmatism in the continental collision orogen. The compositional variations of whole-rock and minerals are used to indicate the heterogeneity of mantle source and the effect of magma mixing. As a consequence, this study provides insights into physicochemical processes in the subduction factory, in which the source mixing is realized through the melt-peridotite reaction at the slab-mantle interface in the continental subduction channel whereas the magma mixing is established by blending of mafic melts derived from partial melting of the heterogeneous mantle domains.",
        "Geological Setting and Samples": "Geological Setting and Samples\nThe Dabie-Sulu orogens in east-central China (lower right insert in Figure\n1\n) were generated by continentcontinent collision in the Triassic [e.g.,\nLi et al., 1999;\nZheng et al., 2003\nZheng et al., , 2013a]]\n. Findings of coesite and microdiamond in Dabie-Sulu eclogites and gneisses demonstrate that the continental crust was subducted to mantle depths of >100 km to experience ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphism\n[Okay et al., 1989;\nWang et al., 1989;\nXu et al., 1992]\n. The UHP metamorphic rocks are prominent in the Dabie orogen and they are mainly composed of granitic orthogneiss, with subordinate eclogite, granulite, amphibolite, marble and migmatite. A number of zircon U-Pb geochronological and mineral O isotope studies demonstrate that the subducted continental crust are primarily composed of Precambrian basement and its sedimentary cover of\nGeochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems 10.1002\n/2014GC005620 the South China Block [e.g., Zheng et al., 2003\n, 2005]\n. According to metamorphic P-T conditions on the outcrop scale, the Dabie orogen can be subdivided into five major lithotectonic units from north to south (Figure\n1\n): (1) Beihuaiyang low-T/low-P greenschist-facies zone, (2) North Dabie high-T/UHP granulite-facies zone, (3) Central Dabie mid-T/UHP eclogitefacies zone, (4) South Dabie low-T/UHP eclogite-facies zone, and (5) Susong low-T/HP blueschist-facies zone. All of these metamorphic units were extensively intruded by postcollisional igneous rocks of Early Cretaceous\n[Zhao and Zheng, 2009]\n.\nPostcollisional magmatism in the Dabie orogen is dominated by voluminous granitoids with minor mafic to ultramafic intrusive and volcanic rocks\n[Ma et al., 1998;\nJahn et al., 1999;\nChen et al., 2002;\nZhang et al., 2002;\nBryant et al., 2004;\nWang et al., 2005;\nZhao et al., 2005\nZhao et al., , 2007;;\nHuang et al., 2007;\nXu et al., 2012]\n. Previous studies have demonstrated that these magmatic rocks were primarily emplaced in the Early Cretaceous\n[Zhao and Zheng, 2009]\n. The mafic-ultramafic intrusive rocks mainly occur in the North Dabie zone, with dominant rock types of gabbro, pyroxenite and hornblendite. They are generally undeformed and exhibit distinct intrusive relations to country-rock gneisses.\nSamples used in this study were collected from the Jiaoziyan area in North Dabie (Figure\n1\n). The Jiaoziyan mafic intrusion is one of the biggest mafic-ultramafic intrusions (30 km 2 in area) in the Dabie orogen. According to petrographic observations and major element analysis, the Jiaoziyan pluton can be divided into gabbro and gabbroic diorite. Some gabbro enclaves can be observed in gabbroic diorite, and they contact the host gabbroic diorite sharply or gradually at various locations (Figure\n2a\n). The gabbro accounts for 80 % exposure of the pluton and is mainly composed of plagioclase (50-60%), clinopyroxene (15-20%), hornblende (10-15%) and biotite (10-15%), with accessory magnetite, apatite and zircon. Compared to the gabbro, the gabbroic diorite contains relatively more plagioclase (60-65%), hornblende (20-25%), biotite (20%), but less clinopyroxene (5%). Most of the rock-forming minerals in the Jiaoziyan mafic intrusion are in the size range of 100-300 lm. Especially, some large clinopyroxene and rare orthopyroxene megacrystals can be observed in some gabbro samples (Figures\n2b-2f\n). Generally, the large clinopyroxene megacrystals can be divided into two groups. Group I clinopyroxene megacrystals (hereafter Cpx-1) exhibit clear zoning with core-mantle-rim structures (up to 3 mm; Figure\n2b\n). Amphibole (hereafter Amp-1) and minor plagioclase occur in clinopyroxene core. Group II clinopyroxene megacrystals (hereafter Cpx-2) are subhedral without clear zoning (Figures\n2c-2e\n), and they are often replaced by amphibole (hereafter Amp-2) at the rim. The boundary between clinopyroxene and amphibole is inter-fingering. Plagioclase inclusion can be observed in Amp-2 (Figures\n2c\nand\n2d\n). The plagioclase megacrystals also can be divided into two groups. Group I plagioclase megacrystals (hereafter Pl-1) exhibit clear zoning with core-mantle-rim structures (Figure\n2g\n). Clinopyroxene, biotite, plagioclase and magnetite inclusions can be observed in the Pl-1 core. There are minor biotite and plagioclase inclusions in the Pl-1 rim. Group II plagioclase megacrystals Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems 10.1002/2014GC005620 (hereafter Pl-2) display clearly core-rim structures (Figure\n2h\n), and the boundary between core and rim is relatively sharp. Plagioclase and minor biotite occur in the Pl-2 rim. Petrographic observations suggest that the orthopyroxene megacrystals do not exhibit significant zoning (Figure\n2f\n).",

Zoned and unzoned clinopyroxene megacrystals coexist in the gabbro samples. These clinopyroxene megacrystals provide detailed records of the geochemical evolution during the fractional crystallization of gabbroic magmas.\nMajor and trace element variations across one zoned clinopyroxene megacrystal (Cpx-1 in 09JZY14), four unzoned clinopyroxene megacrystals (Cpx-2 in 09JZY11 and 09JZY14) that were replaced/unreplaced by amphibole at the rim, and several clinopyroxene grains in matrix are described below.\nCpx-1 is a relatively euhedral megacrystal in gabbro 09JZY14.

        "Discussion": "Discussion\nThe present zircon U-Pb dating yields relatively consistent ages of 126 6 1 to 130 6 1 Ma for the Jiaoziyan mafic rocks (Figure\n3\n). These U-Pb ages are in agreement with known ages for postcollisional magmatism in the Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt\n[Zhao and Zheng, 2009]\n. Furthermore, gabbro 09JZY14 contains a relict zircon core with an U-Pb age of 765 6 8 Ma, which is also consistent with Neoproterozoic protolith U-Pb ages for UHP metaigneous rocks in the Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt\n[Zheng et al., 2004;\nTang et al., 2008a\nTang et al., , 2008b;;\nZhao et al., 2008]\n. Relict zircon cores of the mid-Neoproterozoic U-Pb ages also have been identified in postcollisional mafic-ultramafic rocks at Daoshichong and Zhujiapu in the Dabie orogen\n[Dai et al., 2011\n[Dai et al., , 2012]]\n. Therefore, both the postcollisional igneous rocks and the UHP metaigneous rocks share the same parental rocks of Neoproterozoic age, which have a tectonic affinity to the subducted South China Block\n[Zhao and Zheng, 2009;\nZheng et al., 2009]\n. These mafic rocks exhibit initial 206 Pb/ 204 Pb ratios of 16.121-16.606 (Table\n1\n), similar to those of UHP metaigneous rocks in the Dabie orogen\n[Zhang et al. 2002;\nHuang et al. 2007;\nZhao and Zheng. 2009]\n. This also lends support to involvement of the subducted continental crust of the South China Block in the mantle source of postcollisional mafic igneous rocks. Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems 10.1002/2014GC005620\nSource heterogeneity and magma mixing are two important variables to dictate the composition of igneous rocks in continental collisional orogens. They have been widely recognized by field observations, whole-rock and mineral geochemical studies of both plutonic and volcanic rocks [e.g.,\nKeay et al., 1997;\nMaclennan et al., 2003;\nBonin, 2004;\nYang et al., 2007;\nWinpenny and Maclennan, 2011]\n. While the source heterogeneity is realized by the source mixing of different components in the source, the magma mixing is the mixing between two or more melt batches to form a hybrid magma during melt transport and emplacement. Both the source and magma mixing processes can result in heterogeneous compositions of whole-rock and mineral elements and isotopes [e.g.,\nCarr et al., 1990;\nBarbarin, 2005;\nSun et al., 2010;\nNeave et al., 2013]\n. Thus, it is crucial to identify the nature of source and magma mixing processes when deciphering the petrogenesis of igneous rocks. However, traditional studies of powdered whole-rock geochemistry cannot provide diagnostic information on the distinction between the two processes.\nMicrobeam in situ analysis on different domains of individual minerals has the advantage over the whole-rock analyses to trace the magma mixing in addition to the source mixing\n[Davidson et al., 2007;\nTiepolo and Tribuzio, 2008;\nSun et al., 2010]\n. Pyroxene and amphibole, which are common in mafic igneous rocks and relatively rich in many trace elements, often play an important role in doing so. Several recent studies have indicated the applicability of clinopyroxene and amphibole in situ analyses to identification of magmatic processes [e.g.,\nGuo et al., 2007;\nTiepolo and Tribuzio, 2008;\nWinpenny and Maclennan, 2011;\nChen et al., 2013a]\n. These mafic minerals of large grains can preserve magmatic mineral inclusions, relict mineral phases and complex zoning of major and trace elements, recording the magmatic processes such as fractional crystallization and magma mixing. Thus, the in situ geochemical analyses of minerals, in coupling with whole-rock analyses, are capable of providing robust constraints on the distinction between source mixing and magma mixing during mafic magmatism. Below we examine the two processes of source mixing and magma mixing by an integrated interpretation of major and trace element data as well as stable and radiogenic isotope data.",
        "Source Mixing for Heterogeneously Enriched Mantle Domains": "Source Mixing for Heterogeneously Enriched Mantle Domains\nThe Jiaoziyan mafic rocks exhibit low SiO 2 contents of 45.7-53.9 wt.%, high MgO contents with high Mg# values (up to 70). These compositional features are significantly different from those of felsic melts produced by partial melting of crustal rocks [e.g., Pati no Douce and Beard 1995;\nRapp and Watson 1995]\n, indicating their origination from ultramafic lithology such as peridotite, pyroxenite and hornblendite. On the other hand, they exhibit arc-like trace element distribution patterns such as enrichment in LILE and LREE but depletion of HFSE (Figure\n4\n), indicating the presence of crustal components in them. Furthermore, they display high initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of 0.7066-0.7078 (Table\n1\n), negative whole-rock e Nd (t) values of 217.6 to 25.2 and zircon e Hf (t) values of 229.0 to 27.7, also indicating the presence of crustal components in them. All these geochemical features clearly indicate involvement of the continental crust in their petrogenesis.\nGenerally, there are two mechanisms to incorporate crustal components into mafic melts: (1) crustal contamination of mantle-derived mafic melts during their ascent en route the continental crust (e.g., AFC process); (2) partial melting of the fertile and enriched mantle source that was previously metasomatized by crust-derived components\n[Zhao et al., 2013]\n. Although the Jiaoziyan mafic rocks exhibit relatively variable whole-rock e Nd (t) values of 217.6 to 25.2 and zircon e Hf (t) values of 229.0 to 27.7, they have similar wholerock initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of 0.7066 to 0.7078. Furthermore, there are no significant correlations on the diagrams of whole-rock SiO 2 contents versus e Nd (t) values and ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) i ratios (Figures\n8a\nand\n8b\n). Because SiO 2 is the most mobile component in crustal rocks, SiO 2 -rich melts are always produced by the first batch Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems 10.1002/2014GC005620 of partial melting\n[Zheng and Hermann, 2014]\n. As a consequence, more SiO 2 would be incorporated into the assimilated melt in coupling with crustal Sr-Nd isotope signature if the crustal contamination did take place. However, this is not the case from our data, demonstrating that the crustal contamination did not play a significant role during the melt ascent\n[Zhao et al., 2005;\nDai et al., 2012]\n. Therefore, the arc-like trace element and enriched radiogenic isotope features for the mafic rocks were inherited from their mantle source, which may be the result of source mixing between mantle and crustal components.\nThe Jiaoziyan mafic rocks exhibit variable whole-rock e Nd (t) values of 217.6 to 25.2, precluding a simple, common evolution by the closed-system process of crystal fractionation. Instead, it suggests the source heterogeneity. A two-component mixing trend is well defined on the diagrams of whole-rock (La/Sm) N ratios versus e Nd (t) values and ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) i ratios (Figures\n8c\nand\n8d\n). One endmember is characterized by high (La/Sm) N ratios with low e Nd (t) values but high ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) i ratios, whereas the other is characterized by relatively low (La/Sm) N ratios with high e Nd (t) values but low ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) i ratios. Such a feature suggests that the Jiaoziyan mafic rocks would be originated from a heterogeneous mantle source, which is consistent with the wide range of zircon e Hf (t) values from 229.0 to 27.7. The postcollisional mafic igneous rocks in the Dabie orogen also exhibit variable zircon Hf-O isotope compositions that match a three-layer Hf-O isotope structure for the subducted continental crust of the South China Block\n[Dai et al., 2011]\n. Therefore, we conclude that the source mixing of the mantle peridotite with different components of the subducted continental crust is responsible for the geochemical heterogeneity in the mantle source of mafic igneous rocks.\nThe source mixing between the mantle peridotite and crust-derived components is common at deep oceanic subduction zones [e.g.,\nRingwood, 1990;\nZheng, 2012;\nSpandler and Pirard, 2013]\n. This is generally realized by reaction of the mantle wedge peridotite with fluids/melts derived from subducting oceanic crust, yielding relatively enriched mantle domains for basaltic magmatism.\nWillbold and Stracke [2010]\nalso proposed that source mixing of the mantle peridotite with materials derived from the continental crust and oceanic lithosphere can serve as the enriched mantle sources for ocean island basalts (OIB). This kind of metasomatic mantle sources is generally fertile in lithochemistry and enriched in melt-mobile incompatible trace elements and their radiogenic isotopes. Thus it is susceptible to partial melting relative to the refractory SCLM. The Jiaoziyan mafic rocks in the Dabie orogen exhibit arc-like trace element distribution patterns and relatively enriched radiogenic Sr-Nd-Hf isotope compositions. Such features can be attributed to geochemical inheritance from their mantle source due to the source mixing between the subducted South China Block and the overlying SCLM wedge peridotite\n[Zhao et al., 2013]\n. The variable whole-rock e Nd (t) and Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems 10.1002/2014GC005620 zircon e Hf (t) values suggest that the mantle source is heterogeneous, which would be generated by reaction of the SCLM peridotite with felsic melts derived from partial melting of the different parts of subducted continental crust\n[Dai et al., 2011]\n. Therefore, the source heterogeneity is produced by the melt-peridotite reaction at the slab-mantle interface in the continental subduction channel\n[Zheng et al., 2013b]\n.",
        "Magma Mixing for Mineral Compositional Zoning": "Magma Mixing for Mineral Compositional Zoning\nBesides the whole-rock geochemistry, the texture and mineral chemistry of the Jiaoziyan mafic igneous rocks also suggest their origination from a heterogeneous mantle source with significant magma mixing prior to the final emplacement. In the following discussion, we mainly focus on mineral textures and compositions that provide insights into possible magmatic components, magma mixing and evolution processes that were involved in petrogenesis of the Jiaoziyan mafic rocks.\nThe complex compositional variations of clinopyroxene and plagioclase megacrystals are evident in the Jiaoziyan mafic rocks (Figures\n2,\n5\n, 6, and 7), suggesting that these megacrystals experienced a complex growth history. The highly compatible elements Cr and Ni in Cpx-1 increase from core to mantle, then decrease rapidly in rim. In addition, Cpx-1 core has significantly higher Rb and Ba than those of Cpx-1 mantle and rim. The plagioclase An values of Pl-1 increase rapidly from core to mantle, then decrease in rim. On the other hand, the initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios decrease from core to rim, then increase in rim. All these features argue against their origin from the crustal contamination in open systems or the fractional crystallization in a closed system during their growth from core to mantle. This is because these processes should result in normal zonation in clinopyroxene and plagioclase rather than the reversed zonation. These features also argue against their crystallization from different batchs of magmas that were derived from the same source. Magmas of the same source should have homogeneous isotope compositions, but would not result in the variable Sr isotope ratios in plagioclase. More primitive magmas recharge to magma chamber could explain the high Ni and Cr in Cpx-1 mantle, but this process cannot explain the relatively low Mg# and high Al 2 O 3 in Cpx-1 mantle. In addition, there is a wide range of zircon e Hf (t) values from 229.0 to 27.7 for the Jiaoziyan mafic rocks (supporting information Table\nS1\n), also arguing for the source heterogeneity. All these arguments presented above suggest that either fractional crystallization or crustal contamination, or a combination of both in the continental crust, is unlikely to be the primary cause for the complex compositional variation in the Cpx and Pl megacrystals. They argue for the contribution of source heterogeneity to the generation of the Jiaoziyan mafic rocks.\nAccording to the element and isotope compositions of minerals (especially Cpx, Pl and Amp) from the Jiaoziyan mafic rocks, three principal stages of mineral crystallization can be deduced during mafic magmatism. The first stage is documented in the Cpx-1 core and Pl-1 core. Pl-1 core and the plagioclase inclusions therein, as well as the plagioclase inclusions in Cpx-1 core, all display the similar An values (supporting information Table\nS5\n). In addition, the clinopyroxene inclusions in Pl-1 core also have the similar compositions to Cpx-1 core. All these features suggest that Cpx-1 core and Pl-1 core would probably crystallize from the same melt. The analyzed domains of Cpx-1 core have relatively high Mg# (78.4-80.4), and low Cr (63-847 ppm) and Ni (82-163 ppm) (Figures 5). They are characterized by enrichment of LREE, Rb and Ba but depletion of HFSE, with low REE contents and slightly negative Eu anomalies (supporting information Figure\nS3\n). Amphibole inclusions in the Cpx-1 core also have high Mg# of 66.4-67.3, with relatively low REE contents and arc-like trace element distribution patterns (supporting information Figures\nS3c\nand\nS3d\n). Pl-1 core have low An values of 37.4-42.6, with initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of 0.70749-0.70775 (Figures\n6\nand\n7\n). All these features suggest that the Cpx-1 core and Pl-1 core were crystallized from a mafic melt that has the arc-like trace element distribution patterns and enriched Sr isotope composition. The high Rb and Ba suggest that the felsic melt in the mantle source would be produced by phengite dehydration-driven partial melting. The negative Eu anomalies in the Cpx-1 core indicate coprecipitation of plagioclase. This is supported by the occurrence of plagioclase inclusions in the Cpx-1 core. The orthopyroxene megacrystals also exhibit negative Eu anomalies and low Cr and Ni contents, suggesting their crystallization in this stage. It is known that partial melting of hydrous peridotite yields a lower Ni mafic melt than that of pyroxenite\n[Sobolev et al., 2005]\n. Phlogopite is not only an alkali-rich mineral in the lithospheric mantle, but also rich in LILE\n[Foley et al., 1996;\nIonov et al., 1997]\n. The mafic melts in this stage are characterized by low Cr and Ni, but high Ba, Rb and K (supporting information Tables\nS6\n). This suggests their derivation from partial melting of a Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems 10.1002/2014GC005620 hydrous peridotite with phlogopite breakdown. Such a fertile peridotite clearly results from metasomatism by deeply subducted crust-derived fluid.\nThe second stage of crystallization is documented by a sudden increase in Cr, Ni, TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 in Cpx-1 mantle and An values in Pl-1 mantle, but decrease in Mg#, Rb and Ba in the Cpx-1 mantle and radiogenic Sr isotope in Pl-1 mantle (Figures\n5\n6\n7\n). The Pl-2 core display the similar An values and Sr isotope compositions to those of Pl-1 mantle, suggesting their crystallization in the same stage. The Cpx-1 mantle also exhibits enrichment of LREE but depletion of HREE and HFSE (supporting information Figures\nS3a\nand\nS3b\n). These suggests their crystallization from an arc-like mafic melt with relatively high Cr, Ni, TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 contents, low Rb, Ba and SiO 2 contents, and low initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. For Cpx-2 megacrystals, they also have high Cr, Ni, TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 but low Rb and Ba, similar to those of the Cpx-1 mantle (supporting information Figures\nS5a, S5b,\nand\nS6\n). On the chondrite-normalized REE patterns and the primitive mantle-normalized trace element spidergram, they display similar patterns with enrichment of LREE but depletion of HREE and HFSE. The variably low Mg# values and high REE contents probably suggest their crystallization in the relatively late period of this stage. In the second stage, the mafic melts are generally characterized by significantly high Cr, Ni and Al 2 O 3 but low Rb and Ba, probably suggesting their derivation from a pyroxenite\n[Sobolev et al., 2005\n[Sobolev et al., , 2011]]\n.\nThe third stage of crystallization occurs in the outer rims of Cpx-1, Amp-2, Pl-1 rim, Pl-2 rim and minerals in matrix. Cpx-1 rim and Cpx in matrix all have significantly lower contents of Cr, Ni, TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 than Cpx-1 mantle and Cpx-2 (supporting information Figures\nS5a, S5b,\nand\nS6\n). They also display low Mg# values and high SiO 2 contents. For trace elements, they have the highest REE contents and obviously negative Eu anomalies with arc-like distribution patterns. Amp-2 and Amp in matrix also have similar features with high REE contents but low Mg#, TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 contents, which are significantly different from those of Amp-1 in the Cpx-1 core (supporting information Figures\nS5c\nand\nS5d\n). Pl-1 rim, Pl-2 rim and plagioclases in the matrix also have the same element and isotope features, different from those of Pl-1 mantle and Pl-2 core that crystallized in stage two (Figures\n6\nand\n7\n; supporting information Table\nS5\n). All these observations suggest that these minerals were crystallized in the last stage of magmatic evolution.\nThe compositions of melts in equilibrium with crusyallized minerals can be estimated by using appropriate mineral-melt partition coefficients. By doing this, we can see more directly how the magma composition could be changed during the three stages of mineral crystallization. The magma Mg# values in the first stage (Melt 1) were estimated to be 49-53 (Ave. 5 51; supporting information Table\nS7\n) based on the Mg# values of Cpx-1 core, using a clinopyroxene-melt partition coefficient K D (Fe/Mg) mineral/melt 5 0.27\n[Putirka, 1999;\nPutirka et al., 2003]\n. And the magma Mg# values in the second (Melt 2) and third (Melt 2) stage were estimated to be 48-50 (Ave. 5 49) and 45-47(Ave. 5 46) based on the Mg# values of Cpx-1 mantle and rim, respectively. The trace element composition of melts in equilibrium with the Cpx-1 also has been calculated by applying D Cpx/melt values experimentally determined for basaltic systems\n[Adam and Green, 2006, supporting information Table\nS7\n]. The average incompatible element composition of melts in equilibrium with the Cpx-1 core (Melt 1) is characterized by enrichment of LILE (especially Rb and Ba), positive Pb anomalies but depletion of HFSE (Nb, Ta and Ti) on the primitive mantle-normalized trace element spidergram (Figure\n9\n). The melts in equilibrium with the Cpx-1 mantle (Melt 2) and Cpx-1 rim (Melt 3) exhibit different distribution patterns, which have significantly low Rb and Ba contents (Figure\n9\nand supporting information Figures\nS7a\nand\nS7b\n). Similar to the Cpx-1 mineral zoning, Cr and Ni contents also increase from Melt 1 to Melt 2, then decrease rapidly in Melt 3 (supporting information Figures\nS7c\nand\nS7d\n). Therefore, the calculated melt compositions of Melt 1 to Melt 3 directly record the magma composition changed during the three stages of magma evolution.\nPressures for the three stages of mineral crystallization are also estimated based on the compositions of clinopyroxene using the geobarometer of\nNimis [1999]\n. Since the mafic magmas were derived from partial melting the enriched mantle sources that were metasomatized by continental crustderived felsic melt, zircon would be probably saturated early in the melt during mafic magmatism. A crystallization temperature of 900650 C can be estimated by using the Ti-in-zircon geothermometer of Ferry and Watson\n[2007]\n. Assuming the crystallization temperature of clinopyroxene is also 900 C, Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems 10.1002/2014GC005620 the estimated pressures for the crystallization of Cpx in the first and second stages are 800 MPa. The crystallization pressures of Cpx-1 rim and Cpx in matrix (the third stage) are 600 MPa, significantly lower than those in the first and second stages. The underestimated T by 20 C could propagate into a 100 MPa increase in calculated P for Cpx\n[Nimis, 1999]\n, thus it is difficult to quantify the pressure accurately. Nevertheless, the crystallization pressure in the third stage is significantly lower than that in the first and second stages. As such, magma ascent and differentiation would have occurred mainly in the process from the second to third stages. Therefore, the compositional zonings of minerals record the variations in melt composition from early to late, which can be best accounted for by the magma mixing through accumulation of different batches of mafic melts with possible magma recharge in the level of continental crust.\nMagma mixing is a common process during mafic magmatism. The resulted magmas exhibit transitional properties between different bathes of magmas, commonly having the following geochemical features [e.g.,\nPoli et al., 1996;\nMaclennan et al., 2003;\nMaclennan, 2008;\nDavidson et al., 2007;\nSun et al., 2010]\n: (1) heterogeneous whole-rock element and isotope compositions; (2) variable element and isotope compositions in single mineral crystals (from core to rim) or between different mineral crystals such as zircon, Cpx, Amp and Pl; (3) variable compositions of mineral inclusions in early crystallized phases. Different 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios also occur across Pl phenocrysts and between Pl phenocrysts and groundmass in MORB\n[Lange et al., 2012]\n, demonstrating the magma mixing of mafic melts derived from partial melting of the heterogeneous asthenospheric mantle. Major and trace element zonations of Cpx and Pl phenocrysts were reported in Icelandic basalts\n[Winpenny and Maclennan, 2011]\n, recording the magma mixing between different batches of oceanic basaltic melts. For the Jiaoziyan mafic rocks, they exhibit the variable compositions of whole-rock major-trace elements and radiogenic Nd isotopes, zircon Hf isotopes, Cpx element zoning, and Pl element and isotope zoning. These variations are attributable to the magma mixing between different compositions of mantle-derived mafic melts. The mantle sources of different ultramafic lithologies are responsible for the geochemical variations on the both whole-rock and mineral scales. Therefore, the magma mixing between the different batches of mafic melts would be operated in the level of continental crust during the emplacement of postcollisional mafic magmas in the Early Cretaceous.",
        "Petrogenetic Processes in Continental Subduction Factory": "Petrogenetic Processes in Continental Subduction Factory\nIt is known that the Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt was built by subduction of the South China Block beneath the North China Block to mantle depths of >120 km\n[Zheng, 2008\n[Zheng, , 2012]]\n, which is demonstrated by the occurrence of coesite and microdiamond in exhumed UHP metamorphic rocks in the orogenic belt\n[Okay et al., 1989;\nWang et al., 1989;\nXu et al., 1992]\n. Partial melting of the deeply subducted continental crust is also evident during the continental collision\n[Zheng et al., 2011;\nGao et al., 2012\nGao et al., , 2013;;\nChen et al., 2013b\nChen et al., , 2013c]]\n, giving rise to felsic melts with the continental crust-like signatures of trace elements and radiogenic isotopes. Such felsic melts would react with the overlying SCLM wedge peridotite in the Triassic at the slab-mantle interface in the continental subduction channel, generating the fertile and enriched mantle sources for postcollisional mafic magmatism in the Early Cretaceous\n[Zheng, 2012;\nZhao et al., 2013]\n.\n[Chen et al., 1998;\nLi et al., 1998;\nJahn et al., 1999;\nWang et al., 2005;\nZhao et al., 2005\nZhao et al., , 2011;;\nDai et al., 2012;\nXu et al., 2012]\nas well as negative e Hf (t) values\n[Dai et al., 2011;\nthis study]. These geochemical features indicate the substantial involvement of the continental crustderived components in their mantle sources. Furthermore, relict zircon cores of Triassic and Neoproterozoic U-Pb ages have been identified in these postcollisional mafic igneous rocks\n[Dai et al., 2011\n[Dai et al., , 2012;;\nthis study]. In addition, zircon O isotope analyses yield a large d 18 O variation from 2.3 to 7.3&, most of which are deviated from the normal mantle d 18 O value of 5.3 6 0.3&. And the mafic rocks exhibit the three groups of zircon Hf-O isotope compositions that match the three-layer Hf-O isotope structure for the subducted continental crust in the South China Block\n[Dai et al., 2011]\n. These features indicate that different layers of the subducted continental crust were incorporated into the SSZ mantle sources of postcollisional mafic igneous rocks in the Dabie orogen. This led to the source mixing in the Triassic through the melt-peridotite reaction, in which the hydrous felsic melts derived from partial melting of the subducted South China Block react with the overlying SCLM wedge peridotite of the North China Block at the slab-mantle interface in the continental subduction channel\n[Dai et al., 2012;\nZhao et al., 2013]\n. This generates the metasomatic mantle domains in the orogenic lithospheric mantle, which are referred as the ultramafic metasomes that are susceptible to partial melting relative to the hydrous peridotite\n[Zheng, 2012]\n.\nAs presented above, the Jiaoziyan mafic rocks are also characterized by arc-like trace element distribution patterns and enriched radiogenic Sr-Nd-Pb isotope features. The relict zircon core of Neoproterozoic U-Pb age has also been identified in these mafic rocks. Therefore, we suggest that the crustal components derived from partial melting of the subducted South China Block were incorporated into the SCLM wedge overlying the slab-mantle interface in the continental subduction channel. The variably negative whole-rock e Nd (t) values of 217.6 to 25.2 and zircon e Hf (t) values of 229.0 to 27.7 suggest a heterogeneous mantle source, which was generated by the source mixing through reaction of the SCLM peridotite with the different compositions of felsic melts derived from partial melting of the continental crust. In addition, the complex compositional variations of clinopyroxene and plagioclase megacrystals suggest the magma mixing between the different batches of mantle-derived mafic melts. Therefore, the both whole-rock and mineral geochemistries indicate that Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems 10.1002/2014GC005620 at least two kinds of mantle-derived mafic melts were originated from the heterogeneous mantle source due to the source mixing in the Triassic at the slab-mantle interface in the continental subduction channel.\nIn view of the above observations and interpretations, petrogenesis of the Jiaoziyan mafic igneous rocks can be accounted for by the SARSH model of\nZhao et al. [2013]\nin the following five steps. (1) Subduction (S): the continental crust was subducted beneath the SCLM to depths of >120 km. (2) Anatexis (A): anatexis of the subducted continental crust produces the felsic melts that are enriched in LILE and LREE but depleted in HFSE and HREE. (3) Reaction (R): the felsic melts would react with the overlying SCLM wedge peridotite, generating the ultramafic metasomes that are fertile in lithochemistry and enriched in melt-mobile incompatible trace elements and pertinent radiogenic isotopes. (\n4\n) Storage (S): the fertile metasomes would be stored in the orogenic lithospheric mantle for tens of million years. (\n5\n) Heating (H): the metasomes would become partially melted due to heating at the base of collisional orogen, giving rise to the mafic melts that exhibit the arc-like trace element distribution patterns and variably enriched Sr-Nd-Hf isotope compositions. For the Jiaoziyan mafic igneous rocks, it is the source mixing of Triassic age that results in the petrological and geochemical heterogeneities in the orogenic lithospheric mantle, in which the different compositions of ultramafic metasomes were generated by the reaction between the SCLM wedge peridotite and the felsic melts derived from partial melting of the subducted continental crust (Figure\n10a\n). Partial melting of the heterogeneous SCLM metasomes in the Early Cretaceous gave rise to the different batches of mafic melts for the magma mixing (Figure\n10b\n). (a) The first batch of mafic melts (Melt 1) has high Rb and Ba but low Cr and Ni contents, and enriched Sr isotopes, which crystallized Cpx-1 core, Pl-1 core and inclusions therein. (b) The second batch of mafic melts (Melt 2) has relatively low Rb and Ba but high Cr and Ni contents, and relatively depleted Sr isotopes, which crystallized Cpx-1 mantle, Cpx-2, Pl-1mantle, and Pl-2 core. The storage and differentiation of mafic melts would result in Cpx-2 with increasing concentrations of incompatible elements. (c) With further mixing between the first and second batches of mafic melts and subsequent differentiation and ascent, the mixed magmas (Melt 3) crystallized Cpx-1 rim, Pl-1 rim, Pl-2 rim, Amp-2 and matrix minerals (Stage 3). Whole-rock initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of gabbro lies between those of Pl-1 core (crystallized from Melt 1) and Pl-1 mantle and Pl-2 core (crystallized from Melt 2), providing isotopic evidence for the magma mixing between Melt 1 and Melt 2 (Figure\n7\n). Pl-1 rim, Pl-2 rim and matrix plagioclase generally have similar initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios to those of Pl-2 core, suggesting relatively less contribution of Melt 2 to the generation of gabbro 09JZY11. On the other hand, Pl-1 mantle and Pl-2 core generally have higher An values relative to Pl-1 core, indicate Melt 2 is more mafic than Melt 1. Therefore, the magma mixing in addition to the source mixing is evident in petrogenesis of the Jiaoziyan mafic igneous rocks.",
        "Conclusions": "Conclusions\nPostcollisional mafic igneous rocks from the Jiaoziyan intrusion in the Dabie orogen were emplaced at 126 6 1 to 130 6 1 Ma. They contain a relict zircon core of Neoproterozoic U-Pb age, suggesting involvement of the subducted continental crust of the South China Block in their mantle source. They exhibit arc-like trace element distribution patterns and enriched radiogenic Sr-Nd-Hf isotope compositions, suggesting their origination from enriched SCLM metasomes. Furthermore, variable whole-rock and mineral geochemical compositions suggest their origination from a heterogeneous mantle source with different ultramafic lithologies. The Triassic continental collision and crust-mantle interaction in continental subduction channel is suggested as the tectonic mechanism for the generation of fertile and enriched SCLM metasomes. The source mixing is realized by reaction of the overlying SCLM wedge peridotite with the hydrous felsic melts of different compositions derived from partial melting of the subducted continental crust. This melt-peridotite reaction in the Triassic at the slab-mantle interface in the continental subduction channel results in the heterogeneous SCLM metasomes in the orogenic lithospheric mantle. Different batches of mafic melts would be produced by partial melting of these SCLM metasomes in the Early Cretaceous, leading to variable extents of magma mixing (possible recharge) prior to emplacement at the subsurface. Therefore, the both source and magma mixing processes in the continental subduction factory have contributed to the petrogenesis of postcollisional mafic igneous rocks in the continental collision orogen.\nGeochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems 10.1002/2014GC005620 Universities (WK2080000054).
