As summarized above, existing age data for the arc rocks range from the Late Miocene to Quaternary. Our new data show that the Mirabad pluton in the vicinity of the Taftan volcano formed at 19 Ma, which predated the Taftan volcano for at least 12 Myr(Figure 9). Although 19 Ma ages are unknown from large eruptive centers of the arc like Bazman and Koh-i-Sultan, there are Late Oligocene-Early Miocene magmatic ages reported in the Pakistan Makran, including Reko Diq-Saindak(16 and 22 Ma) Perell o, 2008; Richards et al., 2012 and Ting-Dargun(19 and 24 Ma) Perell o, 2008(Figure 9). It is therefore very likely that the Taftan region and some regions in the Pakistan Makran was magmatically active by the Early Miocene and it is important whether this pulse of magmatism is related to the Makran arc or to the Zahedan-Shah Kuh belt composed of Oligocene-Miocene plutons(Figure 1a).

            "Introduction A fundamental step in unraveling the complex geodynamic history of orogenic belts is the establishment of magmatic records, which involve careful sampling, precise age determination, and geochemical characterization of magmatic products in a given region e.g., Lustrino et al., 2011; Seghedi and Downes, 2011; Prelevic \u00e1nd Seghedi, 2013. This paper investigates the petrogenesis and tectonic implications of a suite of magmatic rocks from the Makran arc, southeastern Iran, which is located in a poorly studied segment within the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt. The arc, which spans across southeastern Iran and southwestern Pakistan, is the surface expression of a 1000 km long subduction system situated between the India-Eurasia collision zone and the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone McCall, 1997 McCall,, 2002. Its volcanic activity is manifested by a linear belt of three large eruptive centers including the Taftan and Bazman volcanoes in southeastern Iran, and the Koh-i-Saltan volcano in southwestern Pakistan, and many small eruptive centers between them. Sparse KAr and 39 Ar 40 Ar age data for rocks from the above volcanoes indicate an age range from the Late Miocene to Quaternary, a period generally taken as indicative of active arc magmatism. However, most previous investigations of the Makran arc have focused on its structure and seismicity Byrne et al., 1992; Kopp et al., 2000; Grando and McClay, 2007; Regard et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2012 Smith et al.,, 2013, and geochemical characterization of its magmatic rocks has not been systematically performed. In this study, we attempt to develop, together with published data, a magmatic record for the Makran arc using zircon U-Pb geochronology, bulk-rock elemental, and Sr-Nd isotopic geochemistry for a suite of magmatic rocks collected in the vicinity of the Taftan and Bazman regions, southeastern Iran. Our objectives are to better understand(i) the timing and duration of arc magmatism,(ii) the petrogenetic processes responsible for any geochemical variations among the arc rocks, and(iii) the tectonic implications associated with the formation of the arc.

            "Tectonic Implications Our results shed new lights on the geodynamic evolution of the Makran presented by McCall 1997 McCall, 2002. He noted that there were probably two coexisting subduction zones in the Makran during the Paleogene, one at which is now the southeastern UDMA and another resulted in a plutonic belt from Zahedan to Shah-Kuh running subparallel to it(Figure 1a). It was proposed that magmatic activity of the latter ceased toward the end of the Oligocene whereas the former shifted out in the Gulf of Oman at the Early Pliocene, a change accompanied by uplift and subsequent formation of the Makran arc. However, the initiation of the Makran arc magmatism at the Early Miocene, as discussed earlier based on our new data, implies that the Makran subduction likely began at pre-Miocene times. Recent zircon U-Pb dating results by Chiu et al. confirm that magmatic activity of the southeastern UDMA continued to the latest Pliocene. In view of the above, a likely scenario is that the Neotethyan subduction zone that generated the UDMA propagated from the northwest to southeast in the Gulf of Oman at pre-Miocene times and northward subduction since then produced the Makran arc(Figures 14a and 14b). A sudden jump of the subduction front at the Early Pliocene, as argued by McCall 1997 McCall, 2002, probably did not happen. Based on available data and observations, we propose that the Makran represents a window of continental collision between the India-Eurasia collision zone to the east and the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone to the west(see Figure 14 for details). It is part of the southern margin of Eurasia where remnant oceanic lithosphere of the Neotethys, as shown by heat flow data by Hutchison et al., has been destroyed in a subduction zone since the Early Miocene. At that time, a large part of Neotethys had been consumed in subduction zones along what are now the Indus-Yarlung suture to the east and the Bitlis-Zagros suture to the west. Prior to Miocene, it is either that subduction was inactive along this segment of the continental margin or that it did happened but left no magmatic record for some unknown reasons. An analogy can be drawn with the eastern Mediterranean that is also underlain by remnant Neot",
            " et al. are consistent with the older age. The Makran subduction system is associated with several characteristic features including high sediment input Platt et al., 1985, gentle dip of the downgoing slab Byrne et al., 1992, and low historical seismicity Byrne et al., 1992. The thickness of the incoming sediments is up to 5-7 km, most of which were accreted to form the accretionary prism and the rest of them might have been transported to greater depths with the subducting slab Platt et al., 1985; Kopp et al., 2000; Grando and McClay, 2007. The source of sediments was likely to be the proto-Indus fan with accumulated sediments from the Himalayas Garzanti et al., 1996, in addition to those eroded from the Makran continental margin. The long arc-trench distance(400-600 km) and seismological data are indicative of a shallow-dipping(2-8) Benioff zone Byrne et al., 1992 Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems et al., 2000. The generally low seismicity of the Makran, especially for its western part, might be attributable to the presence of an appreciable quantity of young and poorly consolidated sediments, which are resistant to accelerating slip associated with earthquakes Marone and Scholz, 1988, on the subducting slab. 10.10022014GC005262 The Makran arc consists of three stratovolcanoes including, from east to west, the Koh-i-Sultan in Pakistan, and the Taftan and Bazman in Iran(Figure 1a), and numerous smaller volcanic centers in between them. The fact that they form an ENE-WSW chain at an angle to the Makran trench has been ascribed to different dips of the subducting slab east and west of the Sonne fault, along which the Ormara microplate was torn from the eastern edge of the Arabian plate Kukowski et al., 2000"

            "Geology of the Makran Subduction System The Makran of Iran and Pakistan is an active arc system where the oceanic portion of the Arabian Plate subducts toward the north beneath Eurasia at a rate of 2 cm per year Farhoudi and Karig, 1977; Verdant et al., 2004. It consists of a trench(i.e., the Makran trench) running roughly east-west at 24 N-25 N offshore in the Gulf of Oman, an extensive(1000 km 3 350 km) and one of the worlds largest accretionary prism Platt et al., 1985; Kopp et al., 2000; Grando and McClay, 2007, the subaerial portion of which is referred to as the Makran ranges, and a chain of arc volcanoes aligned in an ENE-WSW orientation further inland(i.e., the Makran arc). The eastern limit of the Makran is the sinistral Ornach-Nal and Chaman faults, the boundary between the Eurasian and the Indian plates continuing toward the Indus-Yarlung suture. To the west, the Makran passes into the Zagros ranges through the dextral Zendan-Minab-Palami fault system, which extends toward the Bitlis-Zagros suture(or the Main Zagros Thrust), the plate boundary between Arabia and Eurasia Regard et al., 2010. Situated to the north of Makran is the north-south-trending Sistan suture zone separating the Lut block to the west and the Afghan block to the east. A comprehensive review on the geology of the Iranian Makran is given by McCall 1997 McCall, 2002. The age of the subducting Arabian Plate was inferred to be either Jurassic or older Whitmarsh, 1979 or Eocene Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems 10.10022014GC005262 Mountain and Prell, 1990; the heat flow data by Hutchison et al. are consistent with the older age.

Although it could be argued that components 2 and 3 can be taken together to represent subducted sediments whose source rocks reside in the crust long enough to acquire enriched isotopic signatures, we do not prefer such an interpretation for the Makran arc because(i) no negative trend is observed between Th La and 143 Nd 144 Nd for the relatively primitive samples(Figure 12d), as would be expected if the variable addition of old sediment melt to the mantle source happened,(ii) these samples are enriched in terms of trace element concentrations coupled with depleted Sr-Nd isotopic compositions, indicating that the enrichment was a relatively recent event without significant involvement of old sediments in the petrogenesis, and(iii) the Sr-Nd isotopic compositions of the studied samples are not consistent with binary mixing between depleted MORB mantle Workman and Hart, 2005 and global subducting sediment(GLOSS) Plank and Langmuir, 1998 or Tethyan flysch Prelevic et al., 2008(Figure 8).

            "Introduction A fundamental step in unraveling the complex geodynamic history of orogenic belts is the establishment of magmatic records, which involve careful sampling, precise age determination, and geochemical characterization of magmatic products in a given region e.g., Lustrino et al., 2011; Seghedi and Downes, 2011; Prelevic \u00e1nd Seghedi, 2013. This paper investigates the petrogenesis and tectonic implications of a suite of magmatic rocks from the Makran arc, southeastern Iran, which is located in a poorly studied segment within the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt. The arc, which spans across southeastern Iran and southwestern Pakistan, is the surface expression of a 1000 km long subduction system situated between the India-Eurasia collision zone and the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone McCall, 1997 McCall,, 2002. Its volcanic activity is manifested by a linear belt of three large eruptive centers including the Taftan and Bazman volcanoes in southeastern Iran, and the Koh-i-Saltan volcano in southwestern Pakistan, and many small eruptive centers between them. Sparse KAr and 39 Ar 40 Ar age data for rocks from the above volcanoes indicate an age range from the Late Miocene to Quaternary, a period generally taken as indicative of active arc magmatism.

            "Geology of the Makran Subduction System The Makran of Iran and Pakistan is an active arc system where the oceanic portion of the Arabian Plate subducts toward the north beneath Eurasia at a rate of 2 cm per year Farhoudi and Karig, 1977; Verdant et al., 2004. It consists of a trench(i.e., the Makran trench) running roughly east-west at 24 N-25 N offshore in the Gulf of Oman, an extensive(1000 km 3 350 km) and one of the worlds largest accretionary prism Platt et al., 1985; Kopp et al., 2000; Grando and McClay, 2007, the subaerial portion of which is referred to as the Makran ranges, and a chain of arc volcanoes aligned in an ENE-WSW orientation further inland(i.e., the Makran arc). The eastern limit of the Makran is the sinistral Ornach-Nal and Chaman faults, the boundary between the Eurasian and the Indian plates continuing toward the Indus-Yarlung suture. To the west, the Makran passes into the Zagros ranges through the dextral Zendan-Minab-Palami fault system, which extends toward the Bitlis-Zagros suture(or the Main Zagros Thrust), the plate boundary between Arabia and Eurasia Regard et al., 2010. Situated to the north of Makran is the north-south-trending Sistan suture zone separating the Lut block to the west and the Afghan block to the east. A comprehensive review on the geology of the Iranian Makran is given by McCall 1997 McCall, 2002. The age of the subducting Arabian Plate was inferred to be either Jurassic or older Whitmarsh, 1979 or Eocene Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems 10.10022014GC005262 Mountain and Prell, 1990; the heat flow data by Hutchison et al. are consistent with the older age.

            "Tectonic Implications Our results shed new lights on the geodynamic evolution of the Makran presented by McCall 1997 McCall, 2002. He noted that there were probably two coexisting subduction zones in the Makran during the Paleogene, one at which is now the southeastern UDMA and another resulted in a plutonic belt from Zahedan to Shah-Kuh running subparallel to it(Figure 1a). It was proposed that magmatic activity of the latter ceased toward the end of the Oligocene whereas the former shifted out in the Gulf of Oman at the Early Pliocene, a change accompanied by uplift and subsequent formation of the Makran arc. However, the initiation of the Makran arc magmatism at the Early Miocene, as discussed earlier based on our new data, implies that the Makran subduction likely began at pre-Miocene times. Recent zircon U-Pb dating results by Chiu et al. confirm that magmatic activity of the southeastern UDMA continued to the latest Pliocene. In view of the above, a likely scenario is that the Neotethyan subduction zone that generated the UDMA propagated from the northwest to southeast in the Gulf of Oman at pre-Miocene times and northward subduction since then produced the Makran arc(Figures 14a and 14b). A sudden jump of the subduction front at the Early Pliocene, as argued by McCall 1997 McCall, 2002, probably did not happen. Based on available data and observations, we propose that the Makran represents a window of continental collision between the India-Eurasia collision zone to the east and the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone to the west(see Figure 14 for details). It is part of the southern margin of Eurasia where remnant oceanic lithosphere of the Neotethys, as shown by heat flow data by Hutchison et al., has been destroyed in a subduction zone since the Early Miocene. At that time, a large part of Neotethys had been consumed in subduction zones along what are now the Indus-Yarlung suture to the east and the Bitlis-Zagros suture to the west. Prior to Miocene, it is either that subduction was inactive along this segment of the continental margin or that it did happened but left no magmatic record for some unknown reasons. An analogy can be drawn with the eastern Mediterranean that is also underlain by remnant Neot",

The source of sediments was likely to be the proto-Indus fan with accumulated sediments from the Himalayas Garzanti et al., 1996, in addition to those eroded from the Makran continental margin. The long arc-trench distance(400-600 km) and seismological data are indicative of a shallow-dipping(2-8) Benioff zone Byrne et al., 1992 Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems et al., 2000. The generally low seismicity of the Makran, especially for its western part, might be attributable to the presence of an appreciable quantity of young and poorly consolidated sediments, which are resistant to accelerating slip associated with earthquakes Marone and Scholz, 1988, on the subducting slab. 10.10022014GC005262 The Makran arc consists of three stratovolcanoes including, from east to west, the Koh-i-Sultan in Pakistan, and the Taftan and Bazman in Iran(Figure 1a), and numerous smaller volcanic centers in between them.

This indicates that the mantle source is enriched in the more incompatible trace elements(e.g., Nb) or the degree of melting is low, or a combination of both. However, the calc-alkaline character of the studied rocks is consistent with normal degrees of mantle melting in arc settings(i.e., 5-15) and the alternative possibility of magma derivation from an enriched mantle source appears more plausible. Similar arguments apply for elemental ratios ZrNb(12-22), ZrY(5.2-11), and NbY(0.33-0.83) that compare closely to E-MORB-OIB ranges see Sun and McDonough, 1989. We then plot BaYb, ThYb, LaYb, and PbYb against NbYb to investigate the behavior of LILE, LREE, Th, and Pb. As shown in Figure 11, the data plot above the mantle array indicative of the nonconservative behavior of these elements characteristic of arc magmas Pearce and Peate, 1995. Also, the subparallel trends defined by these data to the mantle array can be readily explained by constant addition of a subduction component to the mantle source followed by dynamic melting Pearce et al., 1995. Plank developed ThLa as a rigorous proxy for sediment recycling in subduction zones. The study demonstrated that arc magmas inherit ThLa from subducted sediments and high ThLa is not generated during subduction. Relatively high ThLa of the studied samples can be interpreted in a similar manner by mixing between an enriched mantle end-member like E-MORB and subducted sediments with high and variable ThLa(Figure 12a). No systematic relations exist between the sediment proxy ThLa and BaTh(Figure 12b), a Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems 10.10022014GC005262 proxy for shallow subduction component, or CePb(Figure 12c), a measure of the extent of the positive Pb anomaly. As shown in these diagrams, some samples having BaTh higher than E-MORB and CePb lower than the upper continental crust most likely reflect enrichment of LILE and Pb by hydrous fluid. In addition, the ThLa of the relatively primitive samples clusters over a range of 143 Nd 144 Nd(Figure 12",
            "A Three-Component Model for Magma Genesis The petrogenetic constraints placed in the earlier section allow the establishment of a generalized model for magma genesis in the Makran arc. As described and explained below, the model consists of three components that are essential to explain the geochemical variations of the studied rocks. A depleted mantle component. The component is signified by the unradiogenic Sr and radiogenic Nd isotopic compositions, indicating time-integrated LILE and LREE depletion compared to the Bulk Silicate Earth. The component likely represents the subarc mantle wedge that underwent melt extraction long enough to impart a depleted signal with respect to Sr-Nd isotopes. At Makran, this component is the most obvious in the basaltic samples from the Bazman volcano. A trace element-rich component. The component is marked by enrichments in all incompatible trace elements and is responsible for imparting an orogenic geochemical signature to the mantle source. Although its RbSr is higher and SmNd lower than the Bulk Silicate Earth, the component does not reside in the lithosphere long enough to evolve to enriched Sr-Nd isotopic compositions. The component likely represents partial melts of subducted sediments andor slab-derived hydrous fluid. At Makran, this component is hidden in the relatively primitive samples showing orogenic signatures and depleted Sr-Nd isotopic compositions from the Bazman and Taftan volcanoes. An isotopically enriched component. The component is characterized by radiogenic Sr and unradiogenic Nd isotopic compositions, suggesting time-integrated LILE and LREE enrichment compared to the Bulk Silicate Earth. The component likely represents the continental crust whose elements were extracted from the mantle long enough for the Sr-Nd isotopes to evolve to enriched compositions. In theory, it should also exhibit an orogenic signature as component 2 see Rudnick and Gao, 2003. At Makran, this component is the strongest in the Mirabad and Taftan samples. Although it could be argued that components 2 and 3 can be taken together to represent subducted sediments whose source rocks reside in the crust long enough to acquire enriched isotopic signatures, we do not prefer such an interpretation for the Makran arc because(i) no negative trend is observed between Th La and 143 Nd 144 Nd for the relatively primitive samples(Figure 12d), as would be expected if the variable addition of old sediment melt to the mantle source happened,",

As shown in these diagrams, some samples having BaTh higher than E-MORB and CePb lower than the upper continental crust most likely reflect enrichment of LILE and Pb by hydrous fluid. In addition, the ThLa of the relatively primitive samples clusters over a range of 143 Nd 144 Nd(Figure 12d), indicating that the isotopic variations are not primarily controlled by sediment melt addition(see later discussion). As noted above, the studied rocks have compositions more evolved than any putative primitive magmas such that differentiation by fractional crystallization, with or without concomitant crustal contamination, can be expected. As shown in Figure 13(inset), the tendency for samples with higher MgO to have lower 87 Sr 86 Sr, and vice versa, is consistent with the process of combined assimilation and fractional crystallization. However, the data cluster in a diagram of Sr versus 87 Sr 86 Sr(Figure 13), an observation at odds with the positive correlation between Sr and its isotopic composition in the Bazman arc rocks noted by Ahmadian et al.. The rocks referred to by these authors are, however, belong to the Bazman intrusive complex recently dated using zircon U-Pb method at the Late Cretaceous Chiu et al., 2013 such that these rocks might not be directly comparable to the much younger Bazman volcano. The spread of data in Figure 13 cannot be explained by any simple classical assimilation-fractional crystallization(AFC) models, and we here attempt to model the data using the more robust, energy-constrained assimilation-fractional crystallization(EC-AFC) model established by Bohrson and Spera and Spera and Bohrson. The parameters are given in Table 2, including an initial magma with 500 ppm Sr and 87 Sr 86 Sr of 0. a felsic assimilant with 156 ppm Sr and 87 Sr 86 Sr of 0.7157 and a mafic assimilant with 300 ppm Sr and 87 Sr 86 Sr of 0.7097. The results show that the elemental and isotopic variations of Sr can be modeled by variable bulk distribution coefficients(D) for Sr in magma and assimilant from neutral(D m 5 D a 5 1) to moderately incompatible(D m 5 D a 5 0.",

            "Introduction A fundamental step in unraveling the complex geodynamic history of orogenic belts is the establishment of magmatic records, which involve careful sampling, precise age determination, and geochemical characterization of magmatic products in a given region e.g., Lustrino et al., 2011; Seghedi and Downes, 2011; Prelevic \u00e1nd Seghedi, 2013. This paper investigates the petrogenesis and tectonic implications of a suite of magmatic rocks from the Makran arc, southeastern Iran, which is located in a poorly studied segment within the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt. The arc, which spans across southeastern Iran and southwestern Pakistan, is the surface expression of a 1000 km long subduction system situated between the India-Eurasia collision zone and the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone McCall, 1997 McCall,, 2002. Its volcanic activity is manifested by a linear belt of three large eruptive centers including the Taftan and Bazman volcanoes in southeastern Iran, and the Koh-i-Saltan volcano in southwestern Pakistan, and many small eruptive centers between them. Sparse KAr and 39 Ar 40 Ar age data for rocks from the above volcanoes indicate an age range from the Late Miocene to Quaternary, a period generally taken as indicative of active arc magmatism. However, most previous investigations of the Makran arc have focused on its structure and seismicity Byrne et al., 1992; Kopp et al., 2000; Grando and McClay, 2007; Regard et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2012 Smith et al.,, 2013, and geochemical characterization of its magmatic rocks has not been systematically performed. In this study, we attempt to develop, together with published data, a magmatic record for the Makran arc using zircon U-Pb geochronology, bulk-rock elemental, and Sr-Nd isotopic geochemistry for a suite of magmatic rocks collected in the vicinity of the Taftan and Bazman regions, southeastern Iran. Our objectives are to better understand(i) the timing and duration of arc magmatism,(ii) the petrogenetic processes responsible for any geochemical variations among the arc rocks, and(iii) the tectonic implications associated with the formation of the arc.

            "Geology of the Makran Subduction System The Makran of Iran and Pakistan is an active arc system where the oceanic portion of the Arabian Plate subducts toward the north beneath Eurasia at a rate of 2 cm per year Farhoudi and Karig, 1977; Verdant et al., 2004. It consists of a trench(i.e., the Makran trench) running roughly east-west at 24 N-25 N offshore in the Gulf of Oman, an extensive(1000 km 3 350 km) and one of the worlds largest accretionary prism Platt et al., 1985; Kopp et al., 2000; Grando and McClay, 2007, the subaerial portion of which is referred to as the Makran ranges, and a chain of arc volcanoes aligned in an ENE-WSW orientation further inland(i.e., the Makran arc). The eastern limit of the Makran is the sinistral Ornach-Nal and Chaman faults, the boundary between the Eurasian and the Indian plates continuing toward the Indus-Yarlung suture. To the west, the Makran passes into the Zagros ranges through the dextral Zendan-Minab-Palami fault system, which extends toward the Bitlis-Zagros suture(or the Main Zagros Thrust), the plate boundary between Arabia and Eurasia Regard et al., 2010. Situated to the north of Makran is the north-south-trending Sistan suture zone separating the Lut block to the west and the Afghan block to the east. A comprehensive review on the geology of the Iranian Makran is given by McCall 1997 McCall, 2002.

            "Concluding Remarks The important results of this study are summarized below 1. Magmatic activity of the Makran arc, previously considered to be active from the Late Miocene to Quaternary, might have actually commenced by the Early Miocene. The argument is based on the 19 Ma Mirabad pluton that is geochemically similar to the Taftan volcano. 4. The subduction zone generating the Makran arc might have been propagated from the one resulted in the UDMA to the northwest. The Makran represents a window of continental collision between the India-Eurasia collision zone to the east and the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone to the west.",
            "Tectonic Implications Our results shed new lights on the geodynamic evolution of the Makran presented by McCall 1997 McCall, 2002. He noted that there were probably two coexisting subduction zones in the Makran during the Paleogene, one at which is now the southeastern UDMA and another resulted in a plutonic belt from Zahedan to Shah-Kuh running subparallel to it(Figure 1a). It was proposed that magmatic activity of the latter ceased toward the end of the Oligocene whereas the former shifted out in the Gulf of Oman at the Early Pliocene, a change accompanied by uplift and subsequent formation of the Makran arc. However, the initiation of the Makran arc magmatism at the Early Miocene, as discussed earlier based on our new data, implies that the Makran subduction likely began at pre-Miocene times. Recent zircon U-Pb dating results by Chiu et al. confirm that magmatic activity of the southeastern UDMA continued to the latest Pliocene. In view of the above, a likely scenario is that the Neotethyan subduction zone that generated the UDMA propagated from the northwest to southeast in the Gulf of Oman at pre-Miocene times and northward subduction since then produced the Makran arc(Figures 14a and 14b). A sudden jump of the subduction front at the Early Pliocene, as argued by McCall 1997 McCall, 2002, probably did not happen. Based on available data and observations, we propose that the Makran represents a window of continental collision between the India-Eurasia collision zone to the east and the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone to the west(see Figure 14 for details). It is part of the southern margin of Eurasia where remnant oceanic lithosphere of the Neotethys, as shown by heat flow data by Hutchison et al., has been destroyed in a subduction zone since the Early Miocene. At that time, a large part of Neotethys had been consumed in subduction zones along what are now the Indus-Yarlung suture to the east and the Bitlis-Zagros suture to the west. Prior to Miocene, it is either that subduction was inactive along this segment of the continental margin or that it did happened but left no magmatic record for some unknown reasons. An analogy can be drawn with the eastern Mediterranean that is also underlain by remnant Neot",

The source of sediments was likely to be the proto-Indus fan with accumulated sediments from the Himalayas Garzanti et al., 1996, in addition to those eroded from the Makran continental margin. The long arc-trench distance(400-600 km) and seismological data are indicative of a shallow-dipping(2-8) Benioff zone Byrne et al., 1992 Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems et al., 2000. The generally low seismicity of the Makran, especially for its western part, might be attributable to the presence of an appreciable quantity of young and poorly consolidated sediments, which are resistant to accelerating slip associated with earthquakes Marone and Scholz, 1988, on the subducting slab. 10.10022014GC005262 The Makran arc consists of three stratovolcanoes including, from east to west, the Koh-i-Sultan in Pakistan, and the Taftan and Bazman in Iran(Figure 1a), and numerous smaller volcanic centers in between them. The fact that they form an ENE-WSW chain at an angle to the Makran trench has been ascribed to different dips of the subducting slab east and west of the Sonne fault, along which the Ormara microplate was torn from the eastern edge of the Arabian plate Kukowski et al., 2000"

The ongoing subduction of oceanic lithosphere suggests that the region is still in the subduction phase, but as convergence continues, the arrival of continental lithosphere could eventually shut down subduction and lead to full collision, similar to what occurred in the India-Eurasia system"
