            "The Makran as a Neogene-Quaternary Subduction System One important finding derived from this study is that the Makran arc magmatism might have started considerably earlier than generally appreciated. As summarized above, existing age data for the arc rocks range from the Late Miocene to Quaternary. Our new data show that the Mirabad pluton in the vicinity of the Taftan volcano formed at 19 Ma, which predated the Taftan volcano for at least 12 Myr(Figure 9). Although 19 Ma ages are unknown from large eruptive centers of the arc like Bazman and Koh-i-Sultan, there are Late Oligocene-Early Miocene magmatic ages reported in the Pakistan Makran, including Reko Diq-Saindak(16 and 22 Ma) Perell o, 2008; Richards et al., 2012 and Ting-Dargun(19 and 24 Ma) Perell o, 2008(Figure 9). It is therefore very likely that the Taftan region and some regions in the Pakistan Makran was magmatically active by the Early Miocene and it is important whether this pulse of magmatism is related to the Makran arc or to the Zahedan-Shah Kuh belt composed of Oligocene-Miocene plutons(Figure 1a). Our data show that rocks from the Mirabad pluton and the Taftan volcano are geochemically similar, consistent with a common petrogenetic relationship. In detail, the time-integrated enrichment in Sr-Nd isotopes is a diagnostic feature as the majority of Cenozoic magmatic rocks in Iran are characterized by depleted Sr-Nd isotopic compositions Omrani et al., 2008; Ahmadian et al., 2009; Aghazadeh et al., 2010; Allen et al., 2013; Pang et al., 2013a characteristic of juvenile, or oceanic-type, terrane.

            "Introduction A fundamental step in unraveling the complex geodynamic history of orogenic belts is the establishment of magmatic records, which involve careful sampling, precise age determination, and geochemical characterization of magmatic products in a given region e.g., Lustrino et al., 2011; Seghedi and Downes, 2011; Prelevic \u00e1nd Seghedi, 2013. This paper investigates the petrogenesis and tectonic implications of a suite of magmatic rocks from the Makran arc, southeastern Iran, which is located in a poorly studied segment within the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt. The arc, which spans across southeastern Iran and southwestern Pakistan, is the surface expression of a 1000 km long subduction system situated between the India-Eurasia collision zone and the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone McCall, 1997 McCall,, 2002. Its volcanic activity is manifested by a linear belt of three large eruptive centers including the Taftan and Bazman volcanoes in southeastern Iran, and the Koh-i-Saltan volcano in southwestern Pakistan, and many small eruptive centers between them. Sparse KAr and 39 Ar 40 Ar age data for rocks from the above volcanoes indicate an age range from the Late Miocene to Quaternary, a period generally taken as indicative of active arc magmatism. However, most previous investigations of the Makran arc have focused on its structure and seismicity Byrne et al., 1992; Kopp et al., 2000; Grando and McClay, 2007; Regard et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2012 Smith et al.,, 2013, and geochemical characterization of its magmatic rocks has not been systematically performed. In this study, we attempt to develop, together with published data, a magmatic record for the Makran arc using zircon U-Pb geochronology, bulk-rock elemental, and Sr-Nd isotopic geochemistry for a suite of magmatic rocks collected in the vicinity of the Taftan and Bazman regions, southeastern Iran. Our objectives are to better understand(i) the timing and duration of arc magmatism,(ii) the petrogenetic processes responsible for any geochemical variations among the arc rocks, and(iii) the tectonic implications associated with the formation of the arc.

            "Tectonic Implications Our results shed new lights on the geodynamic evolution of the Makran presented by McCall 1997 McCall, 2002. He noted that there were probably two coexisting subduction zones in the Makran during the Paleogene, one at which is now the southeastern UDMA and another resulted in a plutonic belt from Zahedan to Shah-Kuh running subparallel to it(Figure 1a). It was proposed that magmatic activity of the latter ceased toward the end of the Oligocene whereas the former shifted out in the Gulf of Oman at the Early Pliocene, a change accompanied by uplift and subsequent formation of the Makran arc. However, the initiation of the Makran arc magmatism at the Early Miocene, as discussed earlier based on our new data, implies that the Makran subduction likely began at pre-Miocene times. Recent zircon U-Pb dating results by Chiu et al. confirm that magmatic activity of the southeastern UDMA continued to the latest Pliocene. In view of the above, a likely scenario is that the Neotethyan subduction zone that generated the UDMA propagated from the northwest to southeast in the Gulf of Oman at pre-Miocene times and northward subduction since then produced the Makran arc(Figures 14a and 14b). A sudden jump of the subduction front at the Early Pliocene, as argued by McCall 1997 McCall, 2002, probably did not happen. Based on available data and observations, we propose that the Makran represents a window of continental collision between the India-Eurasia collision zone to the east and the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone to the west(see Figure 14 for details). It is part of the southern margin of Eurasia where remnant oceanic lithosphere of the Neotethys, as shown by heat flow data by Hutchison et al., has been destroyed in a subduction zone since the Early Miocene. At that time, a large part of Neotethys had been consumed in subduction zones along what are now the Indus-Yarlung suture to the east and the Bitlis-Zagros suture to the west. Prior to Miocene, it is either that subduction was inactive along this segment of the continental margin or that it did happened but left no magmatic record for some unknown reasons. An analogy can be drawn with the eastern Mediterranean that is also underlain by remnant Neot",
            " et al. are consistent with the older age. The Makran subduction system is associated with several characteristic features including high sediment input Platt et al., 1985, gentle dip of the downgoing slab Byrne et al., 1992, and low historical seismicity Byrne et al., 1992. The thickness of the incoming sediments is up to 5-7 km, most of which were accreted to form the accretionary prism and the rest of them might have been transported to greater depths with the subducting slab Platt et al., 1985; Kopp et al., 2000; Grando and McClay, 2007. The source of sediments was likely to be the proto-Indus fan with accumulated sediments from the Himalayas Garzanti et al., 1996, in addition to those eroded from the Makran continental margin. The long arc-trench distance(400-600 km) and seismological data are indicative of a shallow-dipping(2-8) Benioff zone Byrne et al., 1992 Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems et al., 2000. The generally low seismicity of the Makran, especially for its western part, might be attributable to the presence of an appreciable quantity of young and poorly consolidated sediments, which are resistant to accelerating slip associated with earthquakes Marone and Scholz, 1988, on the subducting slab. 10.10022014GC005262 The Makran arc consists of three stratovolcanoes including, from east to west, the Koh-i-Sultan in Pakistan, and the Taftan and Bazman in Iran(Figure 1a), and numerous smaller volcanic centers in between them. The fact that they form an ENE-WSW chain at an angle to the Makran trench has been ascribed to different dips of the subducting slab east and west of the Sonne fault, along which the Ormara microplate was torn from the eastern edge of the Arabian plate Kukowski et al., 2000"

            "Geology of the Makran Subduction System The Makran of Iran and Pakistan is an active arc system where the oceanic portion of the Arabian Plate subducts toward the north beneath Eurasia at a rate of 2 cm per year Farhoudi and Karig, 1977; Verdant et al., 2004. It consists of a trench(i.e., the Makran trench) running roughly east-west at 24 N-25 N offshore in the Gulf of Oman, an extensive(1000 km 3 350 km) and one of the worlds largest accretionary prism Platt et al., 1985; Kopp et al., 2000; Grando and McClay, 2007, the subaerial portion of which is referred to as the Makran ranges, and a chain of arc volcanoes aligned in an ENE-WSW orientation further inland(i.e., the Makran arc). The eastern limit of the Makran is the sinistral Ornach-Nal and Chaman faults, the boundary between the Eurasian and the Indian plates continuing toward the Indus-Yarlung suture. To the west, the Makran passes into the Zagros ranges through the dextral Zendan-Minab-Palami fault system, which extends toward the Bitlis-Zagros suture(or the Main Zagros Thrust), the plate boundary between Arabia and Eurasia Regard et al., 2010. Situated to the north of Makran is the north-south-trending Sistan suture zone separating the Lut block to the west and the Afghan block to the east. A comprehensive review on the geology of the Iranian Makran is given by McCall 1997 McCall, 2002. The age of the subducting Arabian Plate was inferred to be either Jurassic or older Whitmarsh, 1979 or Eocene Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems 10.10022014GC005262 Mountain and Prell, 1990; the heat flow data by Hutchison et al. are consistent with the older age.
