Explain everything mentiond about Iran in our database.
What are Mirabad pluton classified as?
Analyze the geochemical discontinuities in Cenozoic magmatic systems of Iran, investigating the transitional mechanisms between juvenile oceanic-type terranes and evolved continental magmatism, with specific emphasis on isotopic signature variations that challenge prevailing petrogenetic models.
What is the numerical value of the NbU ratio reported for the Tau source compared to the Ofol source?"
Describe the mechanisms of rare earth element partitioning during magmatic crystallization, explaining how elemental fractionation reveals magma chamber dynamics.


What did the investigations of the Makran arc reveal?
What is the significance of calc-alkaline affinity in understanding the tectonic evolution of the Makran arc?
What evidence supports the hypothesis that Makran arc magmatism started earlier than previously thought?
Why is the Makran arc considered a transitional zone between the India-Eurasia and Arabia-Eurasia collision zones?
Examine geochemical changes in Iran's Cenozoic magmatism, focusing on the transition from oceanic to continental systems and isotopic variations that challenge existing petrogenetic models.
